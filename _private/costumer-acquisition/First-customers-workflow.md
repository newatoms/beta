# First customers workflow
For the first customers we will need more time than usual to test run the application and workflow.
The first client will participate in a one month startup phase, after which they get a 3 month subscription for a 90% discount. 

## Phase 1: The brief
The client makes a user profile and fils out all the forms.
We discuss the result with the client. 
What do we need to make that possible: User profile, Orgasition profile, Project profile

## Phase 2: Pitching 
We pitch ideas in the application until the client approved 4 pitches, enough for the first month. 
Once we have 4 approved pitches discuss the process with the client.
What do we need to make that possible: Commission pitches

## Phase 3: Approving and publishing post's
we create 4 posts and discuss these with the client in the application until they're ready to be published.
After al post's are approved and scheduled to be published we discuss the process with the client.

## Phase 4: Full test run
After all phases have been tested we fulfill the remaining 2 months only through the application. We are always available through telephone and mail for the client. 

## Phase 5: Review
After the 2 full test months are over we get together with the client and discuss the process.
