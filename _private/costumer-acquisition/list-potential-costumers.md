# Potential first costumers

Here's the list of first potential customers of content.supply. By analyzing possible customers we can filter and even make pitches for them. This is done before we approach them to have a better shot of making them our clients. This document is there to rate potential customers. Describe what their blog is like, can we be of a good help? Where and how can we help them create better content?

Disclaimer: also still a lot of brainstorm ideas so this list is there to better specify and filter to real good potential customers.
