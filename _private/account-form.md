# Account form

We discussed what to ask to a customer who subscribes to a content.supply account. From these questions an editorial brief or formula should be generated. With the answers of these questions we should be able to make worthy pitches.

## General take-aways

The form shouldn't be boring. The tone of voice can be a bit humor-like and informal, not to much though, but it should be fun to fill out. Favorable answers: yes/no questions, multiple choice and always an 'other' option. Flow-chart like.
