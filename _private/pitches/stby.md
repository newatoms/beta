# STBY - Pitches

In this document, ideas for STBY pitches. The idea of the three sections is that we show what the *Goal* is of the post, then how we're going to achieve this (*Method*) and finally what *outcome* is linked to the pitches.

The idea behind showing the *outcome* is that it creates a good overview for us (which outcomes did we covered with the pitches). Not only for us, but for the customer as well, because it shows what the potential outcome is if the pitch is commissioned. It can also provide context.

## Pitch 1: Impact of service design, a small history.

### Goal

To make it clear and understandable what service design is

### Method

We can show the success case about the signage at Schiphol airport that made a huge impact on how we can manage large flows of people. This could be a series and you can make suggestions.

### Outcome

* Create new audience
* Improve perception of the organisation

## Pitch 2: Service design examples in everyday objects

### Goal

To show the necessity of service design

### Outcome

## Pitch 3: Past clients revisited

## Pitch 6: Physical changes caused by design research

### Goal

To show the relevance of design research

### Method

we use disposable objects as an example to show what you can accomplish with good design research, even if you're restricted to use minimal materials. For example how [Julia's](https://www.google.nl/search?q=julia%27s+pasta+ns&espv=2&biw=1680&bih=955&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi01eeC6_nKAhXCPBQKHb1wASMQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=YR90Z-s9-YcGwM%3A) made their fancy disposable cutlery.
