# Text script video (en)
In this video we want to give prospects and investors a short pitch. We want to tell what content.supply is, what our unique selling points are and how it (the app) works.

## Script proposal 

### Start
Content supplied by content.supply (Beta)

Get great custom content for your blog with ease.
You pick, we make, you approve, we post.

### Intro

Whether you want to tell the story of your company, try out some journalistic stories or connect to your target audience through posts they will love, content.supply can provide the content you need.

### Team
Bespoke journalism by a team of specialists focussing on maximal impact. Our team consists of members from multiple disciplines and with different skill sets. Together we create content, from idea to publication.

### How does it work?
With our app you can manage our team behind the computer in your office or on your smartphone. With minimal effort you can act as a *final editor*, the rest is done by us.

1. Sign up online, tell us what you want to achieve with the content, upload style guidelines if you have them and tell us some extra information. This is the fuel for us to start the *pitching-machine*.
2. Our team suggests ideas for posts, you choose which ones to commission. After this our team will start producing and will deliver posts with writing and imagery.
3. After a possible edit and with your approval the post is posted to your blog or Medium publication and promoted on your Twitter and Facebook.
4. Now it starts all over! Commission more posts! The posts will be produced at the frequency you choose, e.g. once per month, week or day.

You pick, we make, you approve, we post.

It is like having an in-house editorial team without the hassle.
