Dear ...

I'm writing form ANB North, you might know us, we're a medium sized broadcaster in the north. We have a television channel, a few radio channels including music and radio channels and we have the website http://anbnorth.news.

Recently it came to our attention in a management meeting that E-Sports is a very big cultural phenomenon and we feel that we should be doing something with it. We would love to pay a small amount of attention to what is happening in E-Sports on our website. 

We were thinking that something once a week would be a good place to start but as with all the companies in our group we're currently downscaling and new recruitment has been frozen. Apart from this, no-one on our news or sports teams feel that they are able to cover this subject effectively.

We want stories that are about the E-Sports phenemonom and As we are mainly a regional broadcaster there should be some extra emphasis on our region with special attention to things happening here and people from here. We would also like the language to fit our wide audience, our readers a bit older and might not understand a lot of the younger peoples and technological terms.

We feel your service might be a solution to problem, as we would have full editorial control while not having to hire someone.

Thanks,

Sophia Lee
Co√∂rdinator News & Sports, ANB North
