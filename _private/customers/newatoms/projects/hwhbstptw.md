*If you look at the news about the environment,*

*you’ll get almost convinced the world is going to end.*

*Yeah sure, a lot of the news on the planet is bad,*

*and it could be hard not to get sad.*

*We thought we could do better, and will let something loose,*

With an overload for negative environmental news, it is easy to miss the positive changes for a cleaner future.

There are so many things happening towards improving the planet on which we live: exciting technological advancements, heroic 💪 initiatives and amazing ideas. We think these things don't get the exposure they deserve.

This newsletter, named *How We Have Been Saving The Planet This Week*, which already has more than 25 issues, was started because we got depressed 😞 about all the negative news that surrounds the health of the environment. The green house effect, polluted oceans, deforestation, world leaders' lack of interest in a cleaner future and so on…

The newsletter brings you just a few awesome things that are happening, right in your inbox 📬👊 every week.
After we produced a few newsletters our mindset changed a 180 degrees.

We see that renewable energy solutions is growing rapidly because of economic benefits. We read about electric airplanes, smart solutions for storing co2 while making hydrogen, wind farms in well known conservative states and much more technological awesomeness.

We found that more than once, articles about new renewable techniques and suggestions of cleaner future advances are written not that saffy and it looks like they are written for incrowd techies rather than to spread the word more broadly about the most awesome things that will save our planet.

Every week we find the coolest articles and make a short explanatory paragraph about why this is so awesome. We do this with an accessible, and perhaps sometimes, nerdy way of informal storytelling. Like we would share the news to our friends in the pub, when we try to convince them to hop on our train to a cleaner future.

Our point of view and mindset about the environment is definitely changing towards a positive future while making this newsletter and we think it would be great if we could share this with as many people as possible.
