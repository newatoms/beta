# You need to inverse your narrative arc
The old way of structuring stories is rendered useless by modern media consumption. You now need to start with the best bits to bait the viewer, and end with some good bits to hook them into continuing onwards.

When we used to make TV (and content for almost every other medium) we would create a build up like this:

A classic narrative arc.

I hate to break it to you, but this seems only to work when a viewer/reader/consumer of your content is guaranteed to go through the whole thing. As in someone in a cinema, someone set on reading all of the articles in the newspaper and in some sense someone watching television. This is hardly ever the case in modern media consumption.

### First impressions matter.
If you make video for YouTube or articles on Medium you need to first of all convince people to watch your video. **The first 2 seconds of your video are the most important.** These seconds are what gets a YouTube viewer excited and focussed, and they are what gets someone seeing a video in their Facebook feed to not scroll on.
The inverse narrative arc works like this:

1. You get people to watch your video, make them interested and excited.

2. You tell them what you think they need to know.

3. You get them to crave more, this is where they continue their path through your content, subscribe etc.
