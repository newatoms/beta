# How collaborating helps you understand the world

The way we see and understand the world is made up of an uncountable number of different experiences and perspectives, which we have gained throughout our lives and have somehow merged into our own views and opinions.

To illustrate how complicated, but also valuable this process is, I would like to discuss the many different ways in which I can experience one single phenomenon: traffic.

No matter what vehicle I am on or in, I feel like *I'm* at the center of traffic and everyone should comply to *my* rules. When I'm walking, I expect people to stop at pedestrian crossings, even though I know they don't really give you any rights in Amsterdam. When I'm on the bike I just want to get from A to B as fast as possible and everyone that is partaking in traffic is basically an idiot that's standing in the way of that goal - especially people who think they have right of way at pedestrian crossings. But then when I'm in the car I feel like both cyclists and pedestrians are hazardous, because they are unpredictable projectiles that don't follow the rules - rules that would make traffic safe, but only if everyone complies to these rules.

You might think I'm schizophrenic as f*ck. However, I like to see this as an example of how I can see things from different perspectives using only myself. Imagine the perspectives and insights I could gain by getting to know other people's perspectives.
