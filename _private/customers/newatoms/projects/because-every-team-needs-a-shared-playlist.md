We have no office, because we believe all of us should decide the best work environment for ourselves. This means no water cooler to stand around, no coffee machine, no copier and most of all, no radio to tune into. So what are we going to do to create a shared experience?

## Because every team needs a shared playlist

Enter New Atoms Worktunes, our collaborative YouTube playlist that serves as our company radio station sans the cheesy DJs.

With new daily additions, the playlist is continually expanding and there is always something new to listen to.

Thomas de Beus is especially happy playing ILoveMakonnen: *I DONT SELL MOLLY NO MORE*; Hodgy; Domo Genesis; and Tyler, The Creator: *Rella for the fun*. Other favorites are MF Doom: *Mr. Clean* and Radiohead: *Lotus Flower*.

Laurence Scherz is listening to Skrillex & Diplo: *To Ü ft AlunaGeorge*, Chinawoman: *Friday night*, Fever Ray, FKA Twigs, The Chemical Brothers: *Go*, ODESZA, and Sevdaliza. And perhaps most of all to Planningtorock: *Let’s Talk About Gender Baby!*

I’m currently enjoying Major Lazer & DJ Snake: *Lean On (feat. MØ)*, ILoveMakonnen, ODESZA and Soldout.

And this is where YouTube Red comes in handy. It allows you to use the site without any ads and to download playlists to your phone for offline listening.

PS: We’ve also recently discovered that we can add notes to songs, so if you have any good ideas about what could go in them, give us a shout.
