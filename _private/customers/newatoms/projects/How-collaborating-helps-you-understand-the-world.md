# How collaborating helps you understand the world

We all have our own worldview. We can try to imagine how somebody else sees the world but this will always be warped by our own ideas and experiences. People are, however, pretty good at upgrading their knowledge when confronted with inconsistencies, obtaining new insights or learning new facts. The most effective method for obtaining these is by actively cooperating with others. In such a situation, you have to focus your discussion on a certain topic, use constructive arguments, and explain your thought process step by step. When approaching unfamiliar topics, you often notice that you are struggling with making claims or backing them up. These moments are very valuable because they show a gap in your knowledge and let you fill that gap by "stealing" the knowledge of others.
