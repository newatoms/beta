# How collaborating helps you understand the world

We all have our own worldview. We can try to imagine how somebody else sees the world but this will always be warped by our own ideas. People are however pretty good in upgrading their knowledge when they are confronted with inconsistencies, obtain new insights or learn new facts. The most effective method to obtain these are by actively cooperating with others. In such a situation you have to keep your discussion around a certain topic, use constructive arguments, and explain your thought process step by step. When approaching unfamiliar topics you often notice that you are struggling with making claims or backing them up. These moments are very valuable since they show you a gap in your knowledge and let you fill the gap by 'stealing' those of others.
