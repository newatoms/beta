# The Psychology and Science of Images

## Goal
To grow both new and existing audiences by showing that New Atoms' methods are simultaneously creative and grounded in science.

## Proposed Method
We will write a post about some of the things that make for an effective image according to psychological and scientific research, and the ways in which we strive to find article-accompanying images based on these ideas.

### Example
We could use the information about appeal, comprehension and retention in the *Sciencing the $@% out of images* as a starting point for this article. We could also exhibit one of our real "image trajectories" and the rationalization thereof (the progression of images we found for an article and our reasons for choosing them, leading to the final image used).

## Motivation
Highlighting and exposing this piece of our process illuminates it in a different light and shows the legitimacy of our decisions, helping to form a positive perception of New Atoms for all readers.
