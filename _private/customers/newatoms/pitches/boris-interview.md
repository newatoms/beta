# The experiences that led to New Atoms

### Goal
To show new and returning readers, potential clients and potential employees that New Atoms is grounded in relevant and formative experiences  

### Proposed Method
We will write an article based on Boris's previous work experiences, what he took away from them, and how they prepared and inspired him to create New Atoms.

### Potential Interview Questions
* What were the most critical takeaways from your work in media and journalism?
* What were the most critical takeaways from your work in technology?
* How did these experiences prepare you to found your own company?
* What inspired you to integrate all of the above?
* Have you had specific experiences that taught you what *not* to do when founding your own company?

### Assistance
A 30-40 minute interview with Boris

### Motivation
Learning about an entrepreneur's experiential trajectory instills confidence in the organization and helps to shape the way it is perceived both by people who didn't formerly know New Atoms and those who have already been introduced to the company.
