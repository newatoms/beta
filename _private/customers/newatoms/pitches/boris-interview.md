# The experience that cried for a new business

### Goal
To show new and returning readers, potential clients and potential employees that New Atoms is grounded in relevant and formative experiences  

### Proposed Method
We will write an article based on one of Boris's previous work experience in journalism, what he took away from it, and how it prepared and inspired him to create New Atoms. This could potentially be a point of departure for a series about Boris's diverse working experiences and how they each prepared him for the present (technology, software development, programming, consulting, designing, etc.).

### Potential Interview Questions
* What were the most critical takeaways from your work in media and journalism?
* How did these experiences prepare you to establish your own company?
* What inspired you to integrate all of the above?
* Did you have specific experiences in the field that taught you what *not* to do when founding New Atoms?

### Assistance
A 30-40 minute interview with Boris

### Motivation
Learning about an entrepreneur's experiential trajectory instills confidence in the organization and helps to shape the way it is perceived both by people who didn't formerly know New Atoms and those who have already been introduced to the company.
