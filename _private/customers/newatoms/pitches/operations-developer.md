# Why an Operations Developer is critical

## Goal
To reach new readers and potential employees by showing the intentional thoughtfulness of the the organisation. 

## Proposed Method
We will discuss the effects of having happy, comfortable and cared for team members on productivity based on research and current working models.

### Example:
We could write about how Sweden's policies on working hours, paid holidays and pregnancy leave (and the effects thereof) inspire progressive companies like New Atoms.

## Assistance
What models, research and ideas have inspired you and made plain the need for an Operations Developer?

## Motivation
Showing that this is important to New Atoms instills confidence in the organisation and helps to shape the way we are perceived. It could potentially assist in reaching people who might be interested in fulfilling this role within New Atoms.
