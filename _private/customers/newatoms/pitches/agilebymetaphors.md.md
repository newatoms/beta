# Explaining agile working in journalism by using metaphors

## Goal

To reach people that will share our content, hire us to write content for them, or that we could hire.

## Method

Write about how agile working adds value to (journalistic) content by using metaphors

### Example:

By using the process of building a bike as a metaphor for agile working in journalism, we can explain how different ways of building a bike result in different forms of quality.

## Motivation

By explaining the process, the content is made relevant for potential new hires. And by explaining the value added, the content is made relevant for potential customers. By using a metaphor you can make agile working more concrete and tangible.
