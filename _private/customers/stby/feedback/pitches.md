### Remarks on certain pitches 

* Ingrid: "Geke mentioned also that we have to make a distinction between projects, these are about a specific project of STBY, and thoughts. The projects we write ourselves. She has the opinion that examples of good service design can be found on our project page. And services of others, like Schiphol, is oke. But only if it is not about a specific company, like Schiphol, but about a more general service, like flying for example."
