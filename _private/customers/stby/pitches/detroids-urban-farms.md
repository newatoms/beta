# Urban farms in Detroit

## Goal

To show the value of the needs of the end users in our society

## Method

We write about (a)success case(s) of citizen initiatives that have found sustainable solutions to problems in our society, that the governments failed to solve. In this article we will use the example of the urban farms in Detroit that have been so hyped in the media lately. We will mainly focus on the phenomenon started, what problems it tried to solve and what the state of these problems is now.

## Motivation

Citizen initiatives are a perfect example of how valuable the perspective and understanding of end users is in having (or not having) a properly functioning service. Apart from the fact that understanding the value of listening to other people is important for everyone, this article might help potential clients see the relevance of service design from a different perspective.
