# STBY's unofficial city awards

## Goal
To show that STBY remains relevant and current by keeping their eye on the ever-changing urban landscape

## Motivation
Stating your opinion about which cities are showing progress or doing a good job with service design will show readers that you are always aware of what is happening in the field on a large scale. Your awareness in this inspires trust.

## Assumptions
That there are cities that are aware of and engaging in service design, and that it is making an impact.

## Proposed Action
We will write an article in which STBY unofficially awards cities for different categories in service design, such as (but not limited to) transportation, environmental awareness, infrastructure, economy, municipal government, implementation of technology, entrepreneurship, most progress, most potential, and an overall winner.

## What we need from you
If you would like to determine which cities are recognised, we would need a list from you corresponding to award categories. We can do the research as to why.

## Outcomes
* Show how good the product/service is

* Show your relevance

* Create insights within the organisation
