# What is it about Bas and Geke that made STBY so good.

## Goal

To gain a personal insight into the driving forces behind STBY – it's originators, Bas and Geke – and how their experiences have made STBY as good as it is now

## Action

We write a blog post about Bas and Geke that mirrors STBY's commitment to it's participant's stories by telling their own narrative. We show where Bas and Geke worked and what they did before starting STBY, what we think they learned from their previous experiences, and how their personal relationship, combined experiences and personalities make them unique and equipped to do what they do.  

## Things we could talk about

How did you guys (Bas and Geke) meet and how much of a role did your relationship play in the formation of your companies? Were there moments that one of you wanted to quit, and did the other encourage you to hang in there? Was it your experience at Lost Boys that set you on the trajectory from consumer research towards service design? What was your experience going back to university as accomplished businesspeople and how did it prepare you to create stby?
