# How people close to us see STBY?

## Goal

To get a more accessible approach of explaining service design 

## Action

we interview Geke’s brother about what he thinks STBY is, what he thinks Geke does, what makes her good at what she does and if he knows any examples in Geke’s daily live that makes her a typical service designer.

## Some of the Questions we have

* What is her greatest quality?

* Is there something you learned from her professional life?

* How did this affect your way of doing things?

* What makes her a good pioneer?

* How do you explain to friends what Geke does for a living?

* Did she in some way designed her own live in a way that makes you think of service design.

## What do we need from you



## Outcome

* Improve relationship with existing audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
* Create insights within the organisation
* Create new audience
* Show how good the organisation is
