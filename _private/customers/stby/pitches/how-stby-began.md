# How people close to us see STBY?

## Goal

To get a more accessible approach of explaining service design and to get a better sense of alternative ways to explain what STBY does

## Action

We interview Gekeâ€™s brother.    

## Things we could talk about

* Where Bas and Geke worked and what they did before starting STBY, what we think they learned from their previous experiences, and how their combined experiences and personalities make them unique and equipped to do what they do

* How their experience taught them that stepping into the life of the participant, hearing his or her story, and authentically integrating the knowledge gained from this experience into the design process makes a meaningful, valuable difference in people's lives

* How their personal and professional take on the emerging field of design research has shaped the scope and profile of STBY

## Questions we have

* How did you guys (Bas and Geke) meet?
* Why are you great at your jobs? In other words, what experiences have equipped you to know that there is a need for service design?
* Have there been times of frustration, and how did you push through these times?
* Was there an "aha moment" when you realized how important people's stories are in design research?
* What are your personal and professional ideas about the emerging field of design research?
* How have these ideas shaped STBY?
* How do your personalities complement one another and make for an effective business partnership? Or, what particular role do each of you play as business partners and why are you equipped to do so?

## Outcome
