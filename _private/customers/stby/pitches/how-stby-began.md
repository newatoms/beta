# How and why did stby begin?

## Goal

To know why and how stby began as a service design/design research company

## Action

we show where Bas and Geke worked and did before starting stby. It's interesting to see what Geke and Bas did before they started stby. That ACS-i media research & projects merged with Lost Boys, that they both were the usability directors at Lost Boys and that they went back to university to get their PhD's to help them run their own service design company.

## What do we need from you

* It would be fun but ot nessecary to have a short interview with Bas or Geke of about 20 minutes

## Outcome

* Improve relationship with existing audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
* Create insights within the organisation
