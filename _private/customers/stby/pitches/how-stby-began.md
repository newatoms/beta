# What it is about Bas and Geke that made STBY so good.

## Goal

To gain a personal insight into the driving forces behind STBY – it's originators, Bas and Geke – and how their experiences have made STBY as good as it is now

## Action

We write a blog post about Bas and Geke that mirrors STBY's commitment to it's participant's stories by telling their own narrative.   

## Things we could talk about

* Where Bas and Geke worked and what they did before starting STBY, what we think they learned from their previous experiences, and how their combined experiences and personalities make them unique and equipped to do what they do.

* How their experience taught them that stepping into the life of the participant, hearing his or her story, and authentically integrating the knowledge gained from this experience into the design process makes a meaningful, valuable difference in people's lives

## Questions we have

* How did you guys (Bas and Geke) meet?
* How much of a role did your relationship play in the formation of STBY?
* Were there moments that one of you wanted to quit, and did the other encourage you to hang in there?
* Was there an "aha moment" when you realized how important people's stories are in design research?

## What do we need from you

* A short interview with Bas and/or Geke of about 20-30 minutes

## Outcome

* Improve relationship with existing audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
* Create insights within the organisation
* Create new audience
* Show how good the organisation is
