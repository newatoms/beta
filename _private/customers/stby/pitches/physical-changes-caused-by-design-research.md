# Physical changes caused by design research

## Goal

To show the relevance of design research

## Action

we use disposable objects as an example to show what you can accomplish with good design research, even if you're restricted to use minimal materials. For example how [Julia's](https://www.google.nl/search?q=julia%27s+pasta+ns&espv=2&biw=1680&bih=955&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi01eeC6_nKAhXCPBQKHb1wASMQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=YR90Z-s9-YcGwM%3A) made their fancy disposable cutlery. Or how HEMA makes their disposable camera's.

## Outcome

* Create new audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
