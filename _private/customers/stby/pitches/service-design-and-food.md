# How service design influences the way you enjoy your food.

## Goal

To introduce recurring new readers who will share the story and who don't know STBY is, and don't realize what service design is, to the blog.

## Action

We will help the reader realize that they come in contact with service design every day, by showing how the positive experience of a service they know is very intentionally designed. For this example we will take a look at the influence of service design on eating. We will compare eating in a super shique restaurant to a home cooked meal with your parents or eating a microwave dinner. It will not be a in-depth analysis but more a rationalized but fun article about he the impact of (sometimes unintentional) service design can have on how you experience your food.

## Motivation

By taking such a obvious example of how everything around the service (eating) has influence on how you experience it, we think we can make the connection between the service design that stby specializes in and the service design that everybody knows.
