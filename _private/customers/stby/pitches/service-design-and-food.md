# How service design influences the way you enjoy your food

## Goal

To introduce (potentially recurring) new readers who are unfamiliar with the term service design, and who would be inclined to share the story, to the blog.

## Action

By showing how the positive experience of a service they know is very intentionally designed, we will help the reader realize that they come in contact with service design on a daily basis. In this post we will take a look at the influence of service design on eating. It will not be a in-depth analysis but more a rationalized but fun article about the impact of (sometimes unintentional) service design can have on how you experience your food.

## Example 

The dutch television program 'de keuringsdienst van waarde', which investigates everyday products on their quality, found out that the shrimps in the 'AH excellent' packaging were exactly the same as those in the normal, cheaper, packages. Would, with this knowledge, buying the 'excellent' shrimps still lead to a more 'luxurious' experience?

## Motivation

By taking such an obvious example of how everything around the service (eating) has influence on how you experience it, we think we can make a connection between the service design that STBY specializes in and the service design that everybody knows.
