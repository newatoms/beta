# How service design influences the way you enjoy your food

## Goal

To introduce (potentially recurring) new readers who are unfamiliar with the term service design, and who would be inclined to share the story, to the blog.

## Action

By showing how the positive experience of a service they know is very intentionally designed, we will help the reader realize that they come in contact with service design on a daily basis. In this post we will take a look at the influence of service design on eating. We will compare eating in a super chique restaurant to a home cooked meal with your parents or eating a microwave dinner. It will not be a in-depth analysis but more a rationalized but fun article about the impact of (sometimes unintentional) service design can have on how you experience your food.

## Motivation

By taking such an obvious example of how everything around the service (eating) has influence on how you experience it, we think we can make a connection between the service design that STBY specializes in and the service design that everybody knows.
