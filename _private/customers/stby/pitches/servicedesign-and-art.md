# How service design is used in the presentation of art

## Goal

To highlight that every interaction we have with the outside world is influenced by service design (good or bad)

## Method

we look at how service design can be used to influence how people experience art in museums and art galleries.
We will look at the effects of service design on both a micro, for example the color of the wall, as a macro level, for example the prestige of the museum. We will not look at a specific art gallery, but discuss existing theories on art presentation.


## Argument

Presentation plays a huge role in the experiencing of art. [John Berger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pDE4VX_9Kk) made a series of realy interesting essay's on how everthing around a piece of art influences the way we look at it, and how this knowledge can be used to the advangtage of both the creator as the viewer. We will use examples like those of John Berger to explain to the reader how you can design a way of viewing that meets the goals of the creator. This article will shed some light on what service design is by highlighting it's effects in an area where most people won't expect it.
