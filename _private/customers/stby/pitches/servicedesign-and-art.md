# To show that service design influences how one perceives art

## Goal

To explain what service design is and how it plays a roll in everything we do

## Method

We look at how service design is and can be used to influence the behavior and experience of art viewers in museums and art galleries.
We will look at the influence the direct context in which the art is presented has on the viewer, and the ways a gallery or museum as a whole influences how we look at the presented art. We will not look at a specific art gallery, but do collect, combine existing theories on art presentations draw conclusions and connect those to service design.


## Argument

Art and the way the creator intended it to be viewed greatly influences the behavior of the viewer and has, in our opinion, a lot to do with service design. This article could shed some light on what service design in a completely different context than they would expect to read about service design.
