# How service design is used in the presentation of art

## Goal

To highlight that every interaction we have with the outside work is influenced by service design (good or bad)

## Method

we look at how service design can be used to influence how people experience art in museums and art galleries.
We will look at the effects of service design on both a micro, the color of the wall, as a macro level, the prestige of the museum. We will not look at a specific art gallery, but discuss existing theories on art presentation.


## Argument

Service design in museums can have a profound effect on experiencing a piece of art. It can for example try to display the piece the way the artist intended it to be displayed, but it can also change it by adding sound, place it next to a very different piece of art or place it in a gallery which tells a story. This article will shed some light on what service design is by highlighting it's effects in an area where most people won't expect it.
