# Privacy versus providing the optimal service

## Goal

Raise STBY's trustworthiness by showing that STBY is aware of the potential negative impact of certain services

## Action

We provoke a 'thought' in users by asking them what the boundaries of service design are, and whether these have changed in the last decade.

## Example

Keeping a history of where somebody went will enable a user to get insight into his/her behavior. However, this information is also very sensitive and could have disastrous effects by falling into the 'wrong hands'.
