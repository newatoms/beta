# Service design in poetry

## Goal

Offer a new perspective of what service design is by discussing a recognizable service: poetry.

## Proposed Action

Poetry is the transfer of a thought/emotion in the optimal form. This is a service provided by the writer to the reader.
We will how poetry is a form of service design by discussing this line of [W.B. Yeats](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/william-butler-yeats):
> A line will take us hours maybe;
Yet if it does not seem a momentâ€™s thought,   
Our stitching and unstitching has been naught.   

## Motivation

Everybody is somewhat familiar with poetry but lot's of people won't have seen poetry as a service. By providing this 'thought', the user will realise and learn something about poetry and about service design.
