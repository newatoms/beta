# Is the aftermath of using a service part of service design?

## Goal

Show that STBY thinks a lot about the broadness and impact of service design

## Method

A lot of services, for example flying, 'harm' the planet. As a enduser you might feel guilty about using the service, so relieving that guilt would be part of service design. We show a few examples of services where, due to a increasing in awareness about the impact of the service, the providers of the service actually implemented a 'relief of guilt' in their service. We also highlight that a lot of services are currently not aware of this impact.

## Motivation

Offers a new insight on what service design is. The article would be recognizable for readers since it's about the choices they make everyday——using a service with a negative effect.
