# Is the aftermath of using a service part of service design?

## Goal

Show that STBY thinks a lot about the breadth and impact of service design

## Method

A lot of services, for example air travel, 'harm' the planet. As an enduser you might feel guilty about using the service, so relieving that guilt would be part of service design. We show a few examples of services where, due to an increased awareness about the impact of the service, the service providers actually implemented a 'guilt relief' in their service. We also highlight that a lot of services are currently not aware of this impact.

## Motivation

Offers a new insight into what service design is. The article would be recognizable for readers since it's about the choices they make everyday——using a service with a negative effect.
