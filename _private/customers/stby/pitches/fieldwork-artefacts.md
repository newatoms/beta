## A Visual Documentation of Process
### Goal
To visually elucidate the process of design research  

### Action
We will show the journey of design research from conception to completion using the visual artefacts produced during the process. Text will accompany the images to create a clear narrative.

### What we need from STBY
Chronological image files of artefacts and a little information about how and why they were created.

### Assumptions
That the process of design research can be comprehensively illustrated by the artefacts it produces.

### Outcome
* Create new audience
* Show how good the product/service is
* Improve perception of the organisation
