# A fun analysis of combined talents   

## Goal

To show the diversity and competence of STBY and to better understand what skills are needed to be a good service design/design research organisation

The combined skills and experiences will be presented in such a way that it seems that STBY is a person in stead of a company.

## Outcome

* Show how good the organisation is
* Improve perception of the organisation
