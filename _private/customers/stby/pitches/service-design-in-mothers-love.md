# love and service design  

## Goal

Help people understand that service design is not complicated, but a very natural thing that they have come in contact with many times.

## Action

We will write and a short article discussing how you behave, and are expected to behave in relation to your loved ones. This could be about how we experience the behavior from our loved ones, and how we have come to expect them to behave, or vice versa. It will be more of an general story about love and expectation in relation to service design, than that it will be a personal story. This will be done to avoid a scenario where you have to publish something that you have experienced differently.

## Motivation

Caring for some one always influences the way you behave towards them. this could be by going out of your way to give them a smile, being brutal honest because you think they need it or lying about something in order to protect them. This behavior feels extremely natural, but I think that by comparing this to service design we can make some fun and interesting connections that introduces service design in a different way. Because it is such a relatable subject it could be an effective item to be shared by others trough social media.
