# With great power comes great responsibility

## Goal

To explain what service design is and to show its capabilities of influencing user behaviour.

## Action

We write an article that discusses and question the ethical implications of conversion oriented service design.

## Example
We could talk about the way advertising agencies use service design. We can discuss how fastfood chains try to create an atmosphere in which people don't want to stick around after finishing their food. We can discuss how supermarkets place their products to increase the chances of selling them. The goal is not to paint a negative picture of service design, but to make the reader aware of the every day encounters they have with service design. This will create a understanding towards what service design is and shows STBY is aware of ethical implications it can have.

## Outcome

* Create new audience
* Grow existing audience
* Improve relationship with existing audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
