# With great power comes great responsibility

## Goal

To explain what sercice design is and to show its capabilities of influencing user behaviour.

## Action

We write an article that discusses the ethical implications of conversion oriented service design.

## Example
We could talk about the way advertising agencies use service design. We can discuss how fastfood chains try to create an atmosphere in which people don't want to stick around after finishing their food. We can discuss how supermarkets place their products to increase the chances of selling them. The goal is not to paint a negative picture of service design, but show the way that STBY thinks about these uses of service design, and that STBY handles the power of service design with great responsibilty. We will do research on this subject and write an article that incorporates quotes of STBY employees. This can be done trough email or by phone. 

## Asistnance
We will need queotes of a stby employee that show their stance on the issues discibed in the artice. This can be done trough email and will not takem more that 30 minutes. 

## Outcome

* Create new audience
* Grow existing audience
* Improve relationship with existing audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
