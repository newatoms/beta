# How to do research for service design

## Goal

To give more insights into the research behind service design

## Action

We show important steps in STBY's research process and what other fields could learn from them. To make this item we would need an interview of around 1 hour with an employee of STBY that was closely involved in the project.

> Interview or additional information from STBY needed.

## Outcome

* Give insight in the organization
* Create new audience
* Grow existing audience
* Improve relationship with existing audience
