# Superchickens ain't so super after all

## Goal

To be able to look at service design from a different perspective

## Method

We discuss a tedtalk by [Mararet Heffernan](https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_heffernan_why_it_s_time_to_forget_the_pecking_order_at_work) where she describes how you can design productivity and successful collaboration within company. The main take a way from her talk is that productivity is not created by a few strong individuals that are supported by others, but by a team of equals where all their different qualities can flourish. She stresses that only greatness can be achieved if there are no ego's in the way, and everyone feels save and adequate to ask and answer questions.

## Motivation

Even though these insights are not as mind-blowing as they might have been 10 years ago, they still suggest a vastly different way of working than the way most companies operate. In this case it ilustrates that if the eployers listen and look better at the need of their employees, both parties are better off. Just like with anny other service where putting effort in listening to the end users greatly enhances the service and thus helps the provider of the service. By sharing this, you create a valuable insight into productivity, and you create yet again a different way of understanding what service design is, wihout explicitly saying it is.
