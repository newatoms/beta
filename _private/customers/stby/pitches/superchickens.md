# Superchickens ain't so super after all

## Goal

To be able to look at service design from a different perspective

## Method

We discuss a Ted talk by [Mararet Heffernan](https://www.ted.com/talks/margaret_heffernan_why_it_s_time_to_forget_the_pecking_order_at_work) where she describes how you can design productivity and successful collaboration within a company. The main takeaway from her talk is that productivity is not created by a few strong individuals that are supported by others, but by a team of equals where all their different qualities can flourish. She stresses that greatness can only be achieved if there are no egos in the way——when everyone feels save and adequate to ask and answer questions.

## Motivation

Even though these insights are not as mind-blowing as they might have been 10 years ago, they still suggest a vastly different way of working than the way most companies operate. In this case it illustrates that if the employers listen and take a closer look at the needs of their employees, both parties are better off. Just like with any other service where putting effort in listening to the end users greatly enhances the service and thus helps the provider of the service. By sharing this, you create a valuable insight into productivity, and you create a different way of understanding what service design is, wihout explicitly saying it.
