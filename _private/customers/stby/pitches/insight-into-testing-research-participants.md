# The process of good user testing

## Goal

To show the competence in, and understanding of STBY's science based testing of services with _research participants_

## Action

We will provide an overview of the process testing participants will undergo and why STBY uses this process.
We will for example discuss how participants are selected, how they are introduced to the testing topic and how their feedback is processed.

## What we need from you

Information on STBY's testing process:
* What questions are asked?
* How many users test the service/design?
* How does the testing differ per type of service?
* On what science articles are these techniques based?

## Pitch is based on these assumptions

* That potential costumers would be more inclined to contact STBY if they can see some tangible examples of the service.
* That STBY has in-house guidelines for these testing practices (or willing to provide answers to a list of questions).

## Outcome
* Show how good the organisation is
* Create new audience
