# The process of good user testing

## Goal

To make the research process accessible for people unfamiliar to service design

## Action

we will explain STBY's science based testing of services.
Possible topics of paragraphs: how _research participants_ are selected, how they are introduced to the testing topic and how their feedback is processed.

## What we need from you

Information on STBY's testing process:
* What questions are asked?
* How many users test the service/design?
* How does the testing differ per type of service?
* On what science articles are these techniques based?

## Pitch is based on these assumptions

* That potential costumers would be more inclined to contact STBY if they can see some tangible examples of the service.
* That STBY has in-house guidelines for these testing practices (or willing to provide answers to a list of questions).

## Outcome
* Show how good the organisation is
* Create new audience
