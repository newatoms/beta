# The Science of Color

## Goal

To show the role color plays in designing services

## Action

We will write an article about the emotional and psychological effects of color and how it can influence our actions, citing specific examples from STBY's past projects.

## What we need from you

Possibly some salient examples, questions answered and insights offered via e-mail

## Pitch is based on these assumptions

That readers would be interested in this specific visual aspect of service design

## Outcome

* Create new audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
* Create insights within the organisation
