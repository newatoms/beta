# The Science of Color

## Goal

To show the competence and understanding of STBY towards user behaviour.

## Action

To show that STBY understands the behaviour of users and what influences their behaviour, we will write an article using the emotional and psychological effects of color and how it can influence our actions as an example, citing specific instances from STBY's past projects.

## What we need from you

Possibly some salient examples, questions answered and insights offered via e-mail

## Pitch is based on these assumptions

That readers would be interested in things that subconsciously affect out behaviour and how STBY uses them to improve service

## Outcome
* Show how good the organisation is
* Create new audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
* Create insights within the organisation
