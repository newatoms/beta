# Service design in movies.

## In order to

introduce recurring new readers to the blog who will share the story and who don't know STBY and what service design is,

## the article will need to have

 a personal relevance to the reader that they will want to share with their network.

## We propose to achieve this by

writing an article where we use fictional services in classic blockbuster movies to explain what service design is and how it influences the experience of the fictional end users. We will try to understand the reason behind the way the service is designed.

## For example,

we could write about how the [service design inside the space ship Aximo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xToQ4cIHkk) in the pixar movie *Wall-e*, where everything is extremely tailored towards the comfort of the end users, eventually has a negative effect on the end user.


## We think this is a effective method to achieve the goal because

by taking fictional services from movies, we can use the emotional value of the movie to invite the viewer to read about a subject they don't know and probably would not actively read about otherwise. This creates relevance for the reader by offering a new perspective on a movie they know and love, which is incentive for sharing the article and its insights with their network.

## The effectiveness of this article is based on the following assumptions:

* That people will enjoy reading insights on movies they value highly
* That there are enough examples of service design in movies to write about
* That the movies we discuss offer enough context to be able to speculate on the motives of the fictional service designer and the experience of the fictional end user
