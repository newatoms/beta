# Service Design is Everywhere

## Goal

That well-designed and intentional yet often unnoticed or taken-for-granted services make our daily lives smoother and more comfortable.

## Action

We will use STBY's past projects as specific examples to illustrate the subtleties of service design.


## Pitch is based on these assumptions

That we are often unaware of the thoughtful design behind our everyday existence

## Outcome

* Show how good the organisation is 
* Show how good the product/service is 
* Create new audience 
* Improve perception of the organisation 
* Show the organisation's impact on the future
