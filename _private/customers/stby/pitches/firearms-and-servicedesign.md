Police officers in Amsterdam with fully-automatic weapons

## Goal

To attract new readers who are not necessarily familiar with service design.

## Action

We will offer a unique perspective on a heated discussion in today's society by writing an article discussing both the reasoning and effects of police carrying fully-automatic weapons in Amsterdam since the 26th of January, 2016.

The intention of the article will not be to disapprove of the arming of police officers, but to clearly give insights into the thought process behind it and the effects it has on the experience of the end users, being both the officers carrying the weapons and the citizens.

## Argument

Anti-terrorism is a heated subject in which people take very active stances, often without sufficient knowledge on the subject. Even though people feel the need to increase security, the arming of police officers feels like too big of a change for a lot of people. We think it is important and interesting to give insights into the reasoning behind this action.

By doing this from the perspective of STBY, a company that provides advise on how to improve the experience of a service for the end user, we give the reader a vastly different perspective on the subject and of service design, making it refreshing, original and relevant.

## Shareability

Linking the change of arms on the national police force to service design can create a better understanding of the subject. Because the safety in our country is a huge topic lately, this post has a lot of sharing potential.  

## Outcome

* Create new audience
* Grow existing audience
* Improve relationship with existing audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
