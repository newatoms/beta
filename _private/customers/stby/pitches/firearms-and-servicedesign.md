# Police officers in amsterdam with fully automatic weapons

## Goal

Show that service design is everywhere

## Method

We write an article discussing both the reasoning and effects of police carrying full automatic weapons in Amsterdam since 26th of January 2016. The intention of the article will not be to disapprove of the arming of police officers, but to clearly give insights in the thought process behind it and the effects that it has.

## Argument

Anti-terrorism is a heated subject where people take very active statements, often without the required knowledge and insights. Even though people feel the need to increase security, the arming of police officers feels like too big of a change for a lot of people. We think it is important and interesting to give insights in the reasoning behind this action by looking at both the intended and unintended influence it has on the behaviour of the end users (the citizens).
