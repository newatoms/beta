# Police officers in Amsterdam with fully automatic weapons

## Goal

To attract new readers who are not necessarily familiar with service design

## Method

we offer a unique perspective on a heated discussion in today's society. We will write an article discussing both the reasoning and effects of police carrying full automatic weapons in Amsterdam since 26th of January 2016. The intention of the article will not be to disapprove of the arming of police officers, but to clearly give insights in the thought process behind it and the effects that it has.


## Argument

Anti-terrorism is a heated subject where people take very active statements, often without the required knowledge and insights. Even though people feel the need to increase security, the arming of police officers feels like too big of a change for a lot of people. We think it is important and interesting to give insights in the reasoning behind this action by looking at both the intended and unintended influence it has on the experience of the end users, being both the officers carrying the weapons and the citizens.

By doing this from the perspective of company that provides advise on how to improve the experience of the end user, we give the reader a vastly different perspective the subject and service design, making it refreshing, original and relevant.
