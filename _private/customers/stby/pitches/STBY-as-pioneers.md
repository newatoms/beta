# STBY as pioneers

## Goal

Convincing potential and existing clients of the fact that STBY is a pioneer in the field of service design.

## Motivation

It's difficult for people who are not in the field to see what aspects of service design are innovative and which are 'standard practice'. Since STBY takes pride in being a pioneer, readers should be made aware of how STBY is innovating the field.

## Assumption

That STBY indeed has innovated in recent projects.

## Proposed action

We will focus on one project, specifically on what the 'standard' way of dealing with a certain problem would be and what STBY did differently.

## Assistance

Point us to the projects where STBY innovated. Answers to a few questions (possibly per mail).

## Outcome

* Show how good the organisation is
* Show the organisations impact on the future
* Improve perception of the organisation
* Show that STBY is accessible, entrepreneurial, inspiring, unconventional.
