# Knowing your user base

## Goal
To show how important it is to connect with you user base

## Actions
We discuss cases where the designers were and were not aware of the needs of the user. We can use the popular social media [design fail](http://9gag.com/search?query=broken+apple+cable) or [trust me i'm an engineer](http://9gag.com/gag/6494774) examples.

## Outcome
* Create new audience
* Improve relationship with existing audience
