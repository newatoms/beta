# Explaining what STBY does in tangible and existing examples

## Goal

To give a professional and accessible explanation of what STBY is, does and what you can expect as an end result of hiring STBY.

## Action

We will write an article of the processes, thoughts and methods STBY works by using examples of the introduction video, cases and opinion pieces we can find on the website.

**Why we think this is good to have**

Currently what STBY does is pretty complicated to understand for outsiders like ourselves. Though the video explains quite well what you do it is a tad bit long and not super enticing to finish. By creating this article we could shed new light on what you do and why this is relevant without repeating what you already said in the video. By using examples from the website we make it more tangible and create the opportunity to link to other blog posts and project descriptions.


## Outcome

* Create new audience
* Improve perception of the organisation
* Improve relationship with existing audience
