# Living Services

## Motivation
Showing that STBY is consistently identifying and reflecting on new trends within the field keeps the company contemporary and relevant to readers.

## Action
We will write an article as a follow up to the question, "Where are the *people* in this picture?" regarding the Internet of Things posed by Yannis Toubakaris in the most recent *Thoughts* post. We will show that the future of service design lies partly in *Living Services*, a new trend identified by [Fjord](https://livingservices.fjordnet.com/) in which the "digitization of everything" (IoT), in tandem with "liquid expectations" (the process by which customers are having a positive experience in one industry, then carrying the expectations of that experience across industry barriers).

## Assumptions

That STBY is open and willing to talk favorably about a trend identified by an industry competitor

## Outcome
* Show how good the product/service is
* Show your relevance
* Show the organisations impact on the future
