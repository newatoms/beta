# Combined Resume STBY

## Who am i
At STBY we've gathered a heterogeneous set of people to build our core team of eight. As individuals, our experiences are unique and specific. Together, we are competent, capable and accomplished. In both domains, we are committed to the continual expansion of our talents. We've not only studied and worked in the Netherlands and England but have departed our comfort zone by amassing different experiences in France, Scotland, Spain and the United States. Here, we'd like to offer an insight into the combined experience that makes STBY what it is and what makes all our endeavours possible.

The collective heatmap of our team members has taught us a lot. We all took varying roads through different landscapes that converge here. Our diverse experiences, from education to work history to inherent talent, form a complimentary and dynamic yet cohesive whole.


## What have i studied and what have i learned from it.
Psychology, Sociology, Cultural studies, Interaction design and research, Photograpy, Marketing and Communication, Computing Sciences, Ethnography, Choreography, Design Interactions, Industrial design, Ergonomics and Consumer Product Design

The social studies have given us a understanding of the way people think and behave while the more technical studies have given us insight into the proces of creating and designing products and services. These two different perspectives help us to understand what the user needs and what the creator is trying to achieve. We try to use our knowledge to bring these two different perspectives as close together as possible.


## Where have i worked and what have a learned from it.
After, during and before finishing our studies i have had quite a few different jobs. In 1993 i have been an ergonomist at Dutch steel producer Hoogovens, where we focused on improving the labour conditions of the employees. I have been a User-Researcher in CitiLab, a public laboratory with the belief that everyone can be creative and innovative as long as they have a conducive environment.
I have been the head of the Open Design Lab and a Concept Developer at the Waag Society, whose mission is "to empower people to make and understand products and processes for more transparency".
I have been Account Manager at	KLM Health Services, where i focussed on keeping private individuals and employees of organisations fit and healthy.
I have investigated the needs and user patterns of costumers and consulted [copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting) for among others: Philips, KLM, KPN, Aids Fonds, Grolsch, and Rijkswaterstaat. I have been a Choreographer for the musical *Hair*.
I have worked for  advertising agency where i had the ability to implement service design towards commercial goals and have experienced a very distinct and measurable way to implement conclusions drawn from knowledge of user behavior. I have been a Freelance Designer and created Printed Materials Designer for EPIC (Ethnographic Praxis in Industry), a congress that focusus on the perspective of the user. I have been consultant at	ArboNed where i focused on improving labour conditions of employees in Holland. I have been the Usability Director at a advertising agency and took responsibility for the development and execution of all consumer research and copy consultancy.

We founded a company where my main focus was on content management (the developing and managing of processes and technologies that support the collection, managing, and publishing of information on digital platforms) and usability research (research of usage of products and service intended to draw conclusions that can increase the effectiveness and costumer satisfaction).



We've done work that revolved around improving the labour condition and health of employees of various companies by looking at the tools they use and the environment in which they work. This has given us a lot of insight into the damage a wrongly designed product or service can do, an how we can solve those problems.

Apart from working at a multiplicity of businesses, we've started our own three times.

Having been involved in the coming of age of the internet-centric business enables us to create a very strong and deep understanding of the workings of internet services and the creation and distribution of digital content.
## How did everything i did atribute to who an where i am now.

Our education, in addition to growing our knowledge base, has enabled us to more fully understand the ways we can *use* our knowledge in order to realize effective service design. It has given us insight within the design process, and not solely in understanding the user. It has also enabled us to become independent from the commercial goals of advertising (increasing sales by using user behaviour) and function more towards improving services by understanding both the design process *and* user behavior.

We tried to improve the services of our customers by engaging in user research, among other things. Practically, this means that we spend a lot of time in dialogue with the user of the service that we want to improve.

Experience that focused on enabling citizens to innovate has greatly enhanced our ability to stand in someone else's shoes. This is something that has also played an important role in our industrial design education, where the emphasis lies strongly on the interaction between the product and the end user.

Our work experience, in its vastness, has taught us to identify and solve problems in complex situations, understand and influence human behavior, and comprehend how businesses function. All of these experiences have laid the sound foundation upon which STBY has been built.
