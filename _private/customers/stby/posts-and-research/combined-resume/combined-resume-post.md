# Combined Resume STBY

The history of our highway to knowledge thought us a lot. Our employees all took different paths to get to where they are now. When combining a team it's important to bring different people with diverse skills together to form a creative whole. From our early studies, post doctorates and PhD's to working experience.

Apart from our associates, at stby we've tried to get a diverse set of people to the team of eight. With different backgrounds, interests and talents. We'd not only studied and worked in the Netherlands and England but break out of our comfort zone collecting different experiences abroad in France, Scotland, Spain and United States. Insights in the people behind a business can give a good representation of what a company is capable of.

## Studies that benefit our companies today

At standby we improve the services of our customers by doing, among others things, user research. This means that we talk a lot with the actual user of the service that we try to improve. Studies that help us to better understand the science behind human behaviour consisting of Psychology, Sociology, Cultural studies, Interaction design and research, Marketing and Communication, Computing Sciences and Ethnography, where the latter is a systematic study and the exploring of cultural phenomena.

It's getting more technical towards our Media and Technology, Industrial design, designing printed materials and Ergonomics background. Consumer products and industrial design at TU Delft. In designing improvement for services we need all these specialties.
