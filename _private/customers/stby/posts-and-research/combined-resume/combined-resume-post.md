# Combined Resume STBY

At STBY we believe that all our strengths come for the combination of skills and experiences of our team members. No one is as good alone as they are together. To show you (and ourselves) how awesome our combined experiences are we will use this article to describe STBY as a person.  because we believe that we are one and thus dependent on each other, but also to create a context in witch it because clear how amazing it is that all these experiences, skills an traits come together.

To explain to you who i am and what i am capable of i think it is suitable to show you how i have gotten to where i am now. My whole life i have been caught between two interests. Human behavior and design. To feed these interests i have done quite a lot of studies. To get a better understanding of workings of the mind of a individual i have studied Psychology, to place this in the context and paint a broader picture i have followed courses in  Sociology and Cultural studies. To give myself insight in the process of creation have studied Interaction design, Industrial design, Ergonomics and Consumer Product Design. I have also studied Computing Sciences, Ethnography, photography and Choreography, studies that both view the process of creation form the perspective of the creator and the user, this give me some handles to bring these two interests together.

After, during and before finishing my studies i have also had quite a few different jobs. I have been an ergonomist at a Dutch steel producer, where I focused on improving the labour conditions of the employees. I have been Account Manager at a aviation company, where i focussed on keeping private individuals and employees fit and healthy.
I have been consultant at a company that i focused on improving labour conditions of employees in the whole of Holland. By trying to improve the health of employees and labour conditions i often had to look at the tools they use and the environment in which they worked. This has given me a lot of insight into the damage a wrongly designed product or service can do, an how i can solve those problems.

In another time and place tried to empower citizens to make and understand products and processes for more transparency and with the belief that everyone can be creative and innovative as long as they have a conducive environment. I wanted to give citizens the means to contribute to the world they live in.  I have done this as a User-Researcher in a public labratory and as head of another open design lab.  My Experience with enabling citizens to innovate has greatly enhanced my ability to stand in someone else's shoes and given me a great deal of insight in the tought proces of users.

I founded a company where my main focus was on content management (the developing and managing of processes and technologies that support the collection, managing, and publishing of information on digital platforms) and usability research (research of usage of products and service intended to draw conclusions that can increase the effectiveness and costumer satisfaction).
Her i have investigated the needs and user patterns of costumers and consulted [copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting) for among others: Philips, KLM, KPN, Aids Fonds, Grolsch, and Rijkswaterstaat. The company got bought up by a advertising agency and i became their
Usability and took responsibility for the development and execution of all consumer research and copy consultancy. Here i had the ability to implement the knowledge i had from both perspectives towards a commercial goals and have experienced a very distinct and measurable way to implement conclusions drawn from knowledge of user behavior. During this time, i have been greatly involved in the coming of age of the internet-centric business enables us to create a very strong and deep understanding of the workings of internet services and the creation and distribution of digital content.

I have been a Choreographer for the musical *Hair*.
I have been a Freelance Designer and created Printed Materials Designer for EPIC (Ethnographic Praxis in Industry), a congress that focuses on the perspective of the user.  

Even tho now i had accumulated quite some knowledge and experience, i did not feel quite equipped to start my own company that brought my main interests fully together. In an attempt to gain the capabilities to implement my finings i studied Marketing and Communication and went to a business school and in the final two years i started STBY.

My educations and work experiences, has enabled me to more fully understand the ways I can *use* my knowledge in order to realize effective service design. It has given me insight within the design process, and not solely in understanding the user. It has also enabled me to become independent from the commercial goals of advertising (increasing sales by using user behaviour) and function more towards improving services by understanding both the design process *and* user behavior.

Our shared work experience and knowledge, in its vastness, has taught us to identify and solve problems in complex situations, understand, take into account and influence human behavior, and comprehend how businesses function. All of these experiences have laid the sound foundation upon which STBY has been built.
