Geke and Bas became usability directors and took the responsibility for the development and execution of all consumer research and copy consultancy. In the [e-mail](email-acs-merges-with-Lostboys.md) they send to all their contacts they said the following; "our experience with being the frontrunner of new media projects is a valuable addition to Lost Boys. Both usability and content are becoming more and more important for the success of e-bussinesses (bussinesses that exist mainly trough online services). ACS-i will expand these disciplines internationally for Lost Boys."
