# Combined Resume STBY

The history of our highway to knowledge thought us a lot. Our employees all took different paths to get to where they are now. When combining a team it's important to bring different people with diverse skills together to form a creative whole. From our early studies, post doctorates and PhD's to working experience.

Apart from our associates, at stby we've tried to get a diverse set of people to the team of eight. With different backgrounds, interests and talents. We'd not only studied and worked in the Netherlands and England but break out of our comfort zone collecting different experiences abroad in France, Scotland, Spain and United States. Insights in the people behind a business can give a good representation of what a company is capable of.

## Social studies

At standby we improve the services of our customers by doing, among others things, user research. This means that we talk a lot with the actual user of the service that we try to improve. Studies that help us to better understand the science behind human behaviour consisting of Psychology, Sociology, Cultural studies, Interaction design and Ethnography, where the latter is a systematic study and the exploring of cultural phenomena.

## It's getting more technical  

It's getting more technical towards our Media and Technology, Industrial design, designing printed materials and Ergonomics background. Consumer products and industrial design at TU Delft. In designing improvement for services we need all these specialties.

## A look at a shared history

Someone has had a job as a Choreographer for the Musical Hair and another was an ergonomist at Dutch steel producer Hoogovens. Ergonomists are scientists who study humans' physical interaction with its surroundings.

## The beginning of STBY

On January 1993, three years after receiving his master degree in cultural studies, Bas Raaijmakers started ACS-i media research & projects with Geke van Dijk as director. ACS-i was  mainly focused on content management (the developing and managing of processes and technologies that support the collection, managing, and publishing of information on digital platforms) and usability research (research of usage of products and service intended to draw conclusions that can increase the effectiveness and costumer satisfaction). They were very involved with the emerging internet industry and conducted many research and consultancy projects.

During their time at ACS-I they did consumer research, where they investigated the needs and user patterns of costumers and [copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting) consultancy for among others: Philips, KLM, KPN, Aids Fonds, Grolsch, Rijkswaterstaat etc.

After 7 years, on 12 September 2000, ACS-i merged with Lost Boys, a renown advertising agency with offices all over the globe. Geke and Bas became usability directors and took the responsibility for the development and execution of all consumer research and copy consultancy. In the [e-mail](email-acs-merges-with-Lostboys.md) they send to all their contacts they said the following; "our experience with being the frontrunner of new media projects is a valuable addition to Lost Boys. Both usability and content are becoming more and more important for the success of e-bussinesses (bussinesses that exist mainly trough online services). ACS-i will expand these disciplines internationally for Lost Boys.

After two years as being the usability directors at Lost Boys Geke and Bas started SBTY, a service design company.

During the first four years of STBY both Bas and Geke went back to university. Bas received his PhD in Design Interactions at the Royal Collage of art and Geke studied Marketing and communication at the renown Nyenrode Business University and received her PhD in computing sciences from the Open University.
