# Combined Resume STBY

The collective heatmap of our team members has taught us a lot. We all took varying roads through different landscapes that converge here. Our diverse experiences, from education to work history to inherent talent, form a complimentary and dynamic yet cohesive whole.

At STBY we've gathered a heterogeneous set of people to build our core team of eight. As individuals, our experiences are unique and specific. Together, we are competent, capable and accomplished. In both domains, we are committed to the continual expansion of our talents. We've not only studied and worked in the Netherlands and England but have departed our comfort zone by amassing different experiences in France, Scotland, Spain and the United States. Here, we'd like to offer an insight into the combined experience that makes STBY what it is and what makes all our endeavours possible.


## A look at our education
During the first four years of STBY, we went back to university. We received our PhD in Design Interactions at the Royal College of art, studied Marketing and Communication at the renown Nyenrode Business University and received our PhD in Computing Sciences from the Open University.

### Human behavior
We improve the services of our customers by engaging in user research, among other things. Practically, this means that we spend a lot of time in dialogue with the actual user of the service that we want to improve. Translating these conversations into useful information requires a certain understanding of the way people think and act and why. The studies that help us to better understand the science behind human behaviour consist of:
- Psychology
- Sociology
- Cultural studies
- Interaction design and research
- Marketing and Communication
- Computing Sciences and Ethnography (where the latter is a systematic study and the exploring of cultural phenomena)

### Technology
Designing improved services requires certain specialties in media and technology. We've studied:
- Industrial design,
- Printed Materials Design
- Ergonomics
- Consumer Product Design


### Conlusions
Our education, in addition to growing our knowledge base, has enabled us to more fully understand the ways we can *use* our knowledge in order to realize effective service design. It has given us insight within the design process, and not solely in understanding the user. It has also enabled us to become independent from the commercial goals of advertising (increasing sales by using user behaviour) and function more towards improving services by understanding both the design process *and* user behavior.


## A look at our working history
Though most of our work experience is highly relevant, we believe that everything we've done contributes to what we do presently, regardless of how idiosyncratic.

### Marketing
By working for prominent advertising agency Lost Boys, we have had the ability to implement service design towards commercial goals and have experienced a very distinct and measurable way to implement conclusions drawn from knowledge of user behavior


### Artistic
We've had a job as a Choreographer for the musical *Hair*.


### Consultancy
We've investigated the needs and user patterns of costumers and consulted [copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting) for  Philips, KLM, KPN, Aids Fonds, Grolsch, and Rijkswaterstaat, among others.


### Society
We have been a Freelance Designer and Printed Materials Designer for EPIC (Ethnographic Praxis in Industry), a company that works to improve industry by looking from the perspective of the user. We were also a consultant at	ArboNed, a company focused on improving labour conditions of employees in Holland.


### Enabling people
Experience that focused on enabling citizens to innovate has greatly enhanced our ability to stand in someone else's shoes. This is something that has also played an important role in our industrial design education, where the emphasis lies strongly on the interaction between the product and the end user.

We have been Account Manager at	KLM Health Services, where we focussed on keeping private individuals and employees of organisations fit and healthy.

We have also been the head of the Open Design Lab and a Concept Developer at the Waag Society, whose mission is "to empower people to make and understand products and processes for more transparency".

We did an internship as an industrial design student at the Care & Health Applications research group at Philips and we were a User-Researcher in CitiLab, a public laboratory that is a simultaneous training center, research center and incubator for business and social initiatives with the belief that everyone can be creative and innovative as long as they're in the right environment.

### User behavior
We have been an ergonomist at Dutch steel producer Hoogovens, where we studied humans' physical interaction with their surroundings.

We became Usability Directors at a renowned advertising agency and took responsibility for the development and execution of all consumer research and copy consultancy.

We founded ACS-i where our main focus was on content management (the developing and managing of processes and technologies that support the collection, managing, and publishing of information on digital platforms) and usability research (research of usage of products and service intended to draw conclusions that can increase the effectiveness and costumer satisfaction).

### Use of tools
We've done work that revolved around improving the labour condition and health of employees of various companies by looking at the tools they use and the environment in which they work. This has given us a lot of insight into the damage a wrongly designed product or service can do, and how we can solve those problems.

### Business
Apart from working at a multiplicity of businesses, we've started our own three times.

### Internet
Having been involved in the coming of age of the internet-centric business enables us to create a very strong and deep understanding of the workings of internet services and the creation and distribution of digital content.

### Conlusions
Our work experience, in its vastness, has taught us to identify and solve problems in complex situations, understand and influence human behavior, and comprehend how businesses function. All of these experiences have laid the sound foundation upon which STBY has been built.
