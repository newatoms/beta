# I am STBY.

A little while back I became the research partner of the “What Design Can Do Challenge”. In the last edition of the challenge we tried to create briefs that inspire and empower designers to come up with ideas that would help refugees and cities adapt to each other. I truly believe that, just like this problem, many problems in our society come from a disconnection between the creator and the user. This can be between goverment and the refugees that try to find a save haven, between students and the education system or a car driver and the manufacturer. Over the past few decades I have, for the most part unknowingly, educated myself to view problems from both the perspective of the user and the creator.
In order to give you an idea how I enabled myself to do this, I will try to describe the road I have taken to get here, and the lessons I learned along the way.

## "My whole life I have been caught between two interests. Human behavior and design."

feed these interests I have done quite a lot of studies and worked in a lot of different places. To get a better understanding of the workings of the mind of an individual I have studied Psychology, and to place that knowledge into the context of society I have followed courses in Sociology and Cultural studies.

To understand different design processes I have studied Interaction design, Industrial design, Ergonomics and Consumer Product Design. I have also studied Computing Sciences, Ethnography, photography and Choreography, studies that both view the process of creation form the perspective of the creator and the user. These educations enabled me to get jobs in my field of interest.

## "To develop my skills after my education I have worked in several positions for a lot of different companies"

I have been an ergonomist at a Dutch steel producer, where I focused on improving the labour conditions of the employees. I have been an account manager at an aviation company, where I focussed on keeping private individuals and employees fit and healthy, and I have been consultant at a company that focused on improving labour conditions of employees in the whole of Holland. By trying to improve the health and labour condition of employees I often had to look at the tools they use and the environment in which they worked. This has given me a lot of insight how these tools where intended, how they were used and the damage a misunderstanding between the designer and the user of a product or service can do. It also taught me a lot about how I could solve these problems.

In another time and place I tried to empower citizens to create and understand products and processes, with the belief that everyone can be creative and innovative as long as they have a conducive environment. I wanted to give citizens the means to contribute to the world they live in.  I have done this as a User-Researcher in a public laboratory and as head of an open design lab.  My experience with enabling citizens to innovate has greatly enhanced my ability to stand in someone else's shoes and given me a great deal of insight in the thought process of users.

## "The first company i founded mainly focused on copy consultancy and user-research"

Here I developed and managing the processes and technologies that support the collection, managing, and publishing of information on digital platforms and I researched the use of products and service with the goal to draw conclusions that can increase the effectiveness and costumer satisfaction.
I have investigated the needs and user patterns of costumers and did [copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting) consultancy for, among others: Philips, KLM, KPN, Aids Fonds, Grolsch, and Rijkswaterstaat. At some point the company I founded got bought up by an advertising agency and I became their usability director. I took responsibility for the development and execution of all consumer research and copy consultancy. Here I had the ability to implement the knowledge I had from both perspectives towards a commercial goals and have experienced a very distinct and measurable way to implement conclusions drawn from knowledge of user behavior. During this time, I have been greatly involved in the coming of age of the internet-centric business enabling me to create a very strong and deep understanding of the workings of internet services and the creation and distribution of digital content.

## "Even though I had accumulated quite some knowledge and experience, I still did not feel like I was ready"

To gain the capabilities to implement my findings in my own company that brought my main interests fully together. I studied Marketing and Communication and went to a business school.

My educations and work experiences have enabled me to more fully understand the ways I can *use* my knowledge in order to produce effective service design. It has given me insight within the design process, and not solely in understanding the user. It has also enabled me to become independent from the commercial goals of advertising (increasing sales by using user behaviour) and function more towards improving services by understanding both the design process *and* user behavior.

## "I am not a person nor am I a group"

I am a collection of people and experiences in different times and places. My whole life I have been searching for a place where I belong and roughly 12 years ago I materialized. All my experience and knowledge, in it's vastness, has taught me to identify and solve problems in complex situations, to understand and influence human behavior, and to comprehend how businesses function. I am STBY.
