# Who are we at STBY

A little while back I became the research partner of the “What Design Can Do Challenge”. In 2016 we tried to create briefs that inspire and empower designers to come up with ideas that would help refugees and cities adapt to each other. I truly believe that, just like this problem, many problems in our society come from a disconnection between the creator and the user. This can be between goverment and the refugees that try to find a save haven, between students and the education system or a car driver and the manufacturer. Over the past few decades I have, for the most part unknowingly, educated myself to view problems from both the perspective of the user and the creator.
In order to give you an idea how I enabled myself to do this, I will try to describe the road I have taken to get here, and the lessons I learned along the way.

## My Studies

My whole life I have been caught between two interests. Human behavior and design. To feed these interests I have done quite a lot of studies and worked in a lot of different places. To get a better understanding of the workings of the mind of an individual I have studied Psychology, and to place that knowledge into the context of society I have followed courses in Sociology and Cultural studies.

To understand different design processes I have studied Interaction design, Industrial design, Ergonomics and Consumer Product Design. I have also studied Ethnography, photography and Choreography, studies that both view the process of creation form the perspective of the creator and the user.

## My Work experiences

To develop my skills after my education I have worked in several positions for different companies. I have been an ergonomist at a Dutch steel producer, account manager at an aviation company, and a consultant at a large labour force oriented firm. Every time my goal was the same, to improving the labour conditions and health of employees. Sometimes inside the company and other times for other firms. In order to do this I often had to look at the tools employees used and the environment in which they worked. It is heartbreaking to see how much damage a misunderstanding between between the designer and the user of a product or service can do.

Later I tried to empower citizens to create and understand products and processes, with the belief that everyone can be creative and innovative as long as they have a conducive environment. I wanted to give citizens the means to contribute to the world they live in. Trying to help people undertake things that where usually outside of their reach was an amazing, and sometimes frustrating experience. It is so easy to forget how much we take our every day activities for granted, even tho they seem unobtainable for others. This joy and frustration greatly reignited my appreciation for what I was trying to and gave me a great deal of insight in the thought probes of users. I have done this as a User-Researcher in a public laboratory and as head of an open design lab.  

During this time I also was a Choreographer for the musical *Hair* and I designed some printed Materials for EPIC 2013, a congress that focuses on the perspective of the user.  

## The first time i started a company

The first time I founded a company, my main focus was on the developing, managing and publishing information on digital platforms and I researched the use of products and service in an attempt to draw conclusions that could increase their effectiveness and make the users happier. I did this for among others: Philips, KLM, KPN, Aids Fonds, Grolsch, and Rijkswaterstaat. At some point the company got bought up by an advertising agency and I became their usability director. Here i continued to do the same thing i had before but the big difference was that the goal was much more commercial, which made it much easier to measuring their effects.

Even tho i greatly enjoyed working at the advertising agency, I did not feel that I wanted to work there for the rest of my life. I decided that to once again I would try to start my own company, this time so that it fully brought my new found interests and insights together. To enable myself to do this and create a clearer understand the business side of things i once more went to university and studied Marketing and Communication and Computing Sciences. Now I was ready.

## Conclusion

My educations and work experiences have enabled me to more fully understand the ways I can *use* my knowledge in order to produce effective service design. It has given me insight within the design process, and not solely in understanding the user. It has also enabled me to become independent from the commercial goals of advertising (increasing sales by using user behaviour) and function more towards improving services by understanding both the design process *and* user behavior.

I am not a person nor am I a group. I am a collection of people and experiences in different times and places. My whole life I have been searching for a place where I belong and roughly 12 years ago I materialized. All the things I have learned have taught me to identify and solve problems in complex situations, to understand and influence human behavior, and to comprehend how businesses function. I am STBY.
