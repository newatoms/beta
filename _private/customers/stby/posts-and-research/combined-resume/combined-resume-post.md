# I am STBY.

A little while back I became the research partner of the *What Design Can Do* Challenge. In the last edition of the challenge we worked to create briefs that inspire and empower designers to come up with ideas that would help refugees and cities adapt to each other. I truly believe that, just like this problem, many problems in our society come from a disconnect between the creator and the user. This can be between government and the refugees that try to find a safe haven, between the education system and its students, or a car manufacturer and a driver.

Over the past few decades I have, for the most part unknowingly, educated myself to view problems from both the perspective of the user and the creator. In order to give you an idea of how I enabled myself to do this, I will try to describe the road I have taken to get here, and the lessons I learned along the way.


## “My whole life I have been caught between two interests: human behavior and design.”

To feed these interests, I have done quite a variety of studies and worked in a lot of different places. To get a better understanding of the workings of the mind of an individual I have studied Psychology, and to place that knowledge into the context of society I have followed courses in Sociology and Cultural studies.

To understand different design processes I have studied Interaction design, Industrial design, Ergonomics and Consumer Product Design. I have also studied Ethnography, Photography and Choreography, studies that view the process of creation from the perspective of both the creator and the user.

## "I have always operated with the objective of making things better for people.”


To develop my skills after my education, I have worked in several positions for a lot of different companies. I have been an ergonomist at a Dutch steel producer, an account manager at an aviation company, and a consultant at a large labour force-oriented firm. Every time my goal was the same: to improve the labour conditions and health of employees, sometimes within the company and other times for other firms. In order to do this, I often had to look at the tools employees used and the environment in which they worked. I found it heartbreaking to see how much damage a misunderstanding between the designer and the user of a product or service can do.

Later, I tried to empower citizens to create and understand products and processes with the belief that everyone can be creative and innovative as long as they have a conducive environment. I wanted to give citizens the means to contribute to the world in which they live. It is so easy to forget how much we take our everyday activities for granted, even though they may seem unobtainable to others. Trying to help people undertake things that are usually outside their reach was an amazing and sometimes frustrating experience.  

 This joy and frustration greatly reignited my appreciation for what I was attempting to do and gave me a great deal of insight into the thought processes of the people I was trying to help. I have done this as a User-Researcher in a public laboratory and as head of an open design lab.  

During this time I was also a Choreographer for the musical *Hair*, and I designed some printed materials for EPIC 2013, a congress that focuses on the perspective of the user.  


## “The first company I founded mainly focused on copy consultancy and user-research.”

I researched the use of products and service in an attempt to draw conclusions that could increase their effectiveness and make the users happier. I did this for Philips, KLM, KPN, Aids Fonds, Grolsch, and Rijkswaterstaat, among others. At some point, the company was bought by an advertising agency and I became their usability director. Here, I continued to do the same thing I had before, but the big difference was that the goal was much more commercial, making it much easier to measure the effects of products and services.

Even though I greatly enjoyed working at the advertising agency, I did not feel that I wanted to work there for the rest of my life. I decided that once again I would try to start my own company, but this time it would be something that fully brought my new-found interests and insights together. To enable myself to do this and to more clearly understand the business side of things, I returned to university and studied Marketing, Communication and Computing Sciences. Now I was ready.

## “I am not a person nor am I a group.”

My education and work experiences have enabled me to more fully understand the ways I can *use* my knowledge in order to produce effective service design. It has given me insight within the design process, and not solely in understanding the user. It has also enabled me to become independent from the commercial goals of advertising (increasing sales by using user behaviour) and function more towards improving services by understanding both the design process *and* user behavior.

I am a collection of people and experiences in different times and places. For my whole life I have been searching for a place where I belong, and roughly 12 years ago I materialized. All the things I've learned have taught me to identify and solve problems in complex situations, to understand and influence human behavior, and to comprehend how businesses function.
