# Combined Resume STBY

The history of our highway to knowledge thought us a lot. Our employees all took different paths to get to where they are now. When combining a team it's important to bring different people with diverse skills together to form a creative whole. From our early studies, post doctorates and PhD's to working experience.

Apart from our associates, at stby we've tried to get a diverse set of people to the team of eight. With different backgrounds, interests and talents. We'd not only studied and worked in the Netherlands and England but have broken out of our comfort zone by collecting different experiences abroad in France, Scotland, Spain and United States. Insights in the people behind a business can give a good representation of what a company is capable of.

## Studies that benefit our companies today

At standby we improve the services of our customers by doing, among others things, user research. This means that we talk a lot with the actual user of the service that we try to improve. Studies that help us to better understand the science behind human behaviour consisting of Psychology, Sociology, Cultural studies, Interaction design and research, Marketing and Communication, Computing Sciences and Ethnography, where the latter is a systematic study and the exploring of cultural phenomena.

It's getting more technical towards our Media and Technology, Industrial design, designing printed materials and Ergonomics background. Consumer products and industrial design at TU Delft. In designing improvement for services we need all these specialties.

##A look at a working history

We had a job as a Choreographer for the Musical Hair and another was an ergonomist at Dutch steel producer Hoogovens. Ergonomists are scientists who study humans' physical interaction with its surroundings.

We were a student assistant product design and marketing communication at the TU Delft.

We founded ACS-i where our main focus was on content management (the developing and managing of processes and technologies that support the collection, managing, and publishing of information on digital platforms) and usability research (research of usage of products and service intended to draw conclusions that can increase the effectiveness and costumer satisfaction).

We got bought up and became usability directors at a renown advertising agency and took the responsibility for the development and execution of all consumer research and copy consultancy.

By working for a advertising agency we have had the ability to implement the service design towards commercial goals and experienced a very distinct and measurable way to implement conclusions drawn from their knowledge of user behavior

By having been involved in the coming of age of the internet businesses enabling us to created a very strong and deep understanding of the workings of internet services and the creation and distribution of digital content.

We investigated the needs and user patterns of costumers and [copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copywriting) consultancy for among others: Philips, KLM, KPN, Aids Fonds, Grolsch, Rijkswaterstaat etc.

We did an internship as a industrial design student at	the Care & Health Applications research group at Philips.

We where a user researcher in	CitiLab, a public laboratory that is a mix between a training center, a research center and an incubator for business and social initiatives with the believe that everyone can be creative and innovative as long as they have the required environment.

We also have been the head of the Open Design Lab and Concept developer at the Waag Society. "The mission of Waag Society’s Open Design Lab is to empower people to make and understand products and processes, for more transparency".

We were a Consultant at	ArboNed, a company focused on improving labour conditions of employees in Holland.

We have been account manager at the	KLM Health Services, where they focus on keeping private individuals and employees of organisations fit and healthy. We started our own company as Service designer and insights specialist called Mrs. Slocombe.

We have been a Freelance Designer from and designed printed materials for EPIC (Ethnographic Praxis in Industry) 2013. EPIC is the systematic study of people and cultures where the researcher observes society from the point of view of the subject and the industrial implementations the emerge from it. Simply put, how can we improve thing by looking from the perspective of the user.

our psychology background has given us insight in to user behavior and our media-technology master has given us insight in the design process.

The work experience that focused on enabling citizens to innovate. This has greatly enhanced our abilities to stand in someone else's shoes, something that also played a important role in our industrial design education, where the emphasis lies strongly on the interaction between the product and the end user.

The work we did that revolved around improving the labour condition and health of employees of various companies by looking at the tools used and environment they are in.  This has given us a lot of insight the damage a wrongly designed product or service can do, an how we can solve those problems.

Apart from working at businesses we started our own three times.

During the first four years of STBY we went back to university. We received our PhD in Design Interactions at the Royal Collage of art, studied Marketing and communication at the renown Nyenrode Business University and received our PhD in computing sciences from the Open University.

These studies enabled us to more fully understand the ways we can use our knowledge of service design by giving us insight within the design processes, and not just only understanding the user.  It enables us to be independent from the commercial goals of Lost Boys (increasing sales by using user behaviour) and function more towards improving services by understand both the design process as the user behavior.
