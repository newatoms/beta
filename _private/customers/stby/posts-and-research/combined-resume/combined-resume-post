# Work experience Geke van Dijk en Bas Rijkmakers
On January 1993 Bas Raaimakers started ACS-i media research & projects with Geke van Dijk as director. ACS-i was  mainly focused on content management and usability research. After 7 years, on 12 September 2000, ACS-i merged with lost boys, a renown advertising agency with offices all over the globe. Geke and Bas became usability directors. In the email they send to all their contacts they said the following; "our yearlong experience with being the frontrunner of new media projects is a valuable addition to Lostboys. Both usability and content are becoming more and more important for the success of e-bussinesses. ACS-i will expand these disciplines internationally for lost boys." After two years as being the usability directors Geke and Bas started SBTY, a service design company.
