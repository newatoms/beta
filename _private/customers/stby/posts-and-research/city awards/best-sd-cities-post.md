# Cities are like organisms

Healthy organisms adapt and evolve based on what is happening in the world around them. Cities are ever-changing organisms, and part of their evolution and adaptation are the large-scale services they offer to their citizens and the quality thereof. Because these services are so important for the quality of our lives, it is important to be aware that these services influence our lives and which cities do it exemplary well.

## An example of an ideal organism

Though long overlooked as a European tourist destination **Vienna, Austria** “...has ranked top in the last seven published rankings,” said [Mercer](http://www.mercer.com/newsroom/western-european-cities-top-quality-of-living-ranking-mercer.html) after releasing their 2016 [Quality of Living Survey](https://www.imercer.com/content/mobility/quality-of-living-city-rankings.html). “It scores highly in a number of categories; it provides a safe and stable environment to live in, a high level of public utilities and transport facilities, and good recreational facilities.”

Vienna's housing is uniquely affordable among major cities due to a long tradition of investing in high-quality social housing. The city's public transport is among the most frequent and affordable, and it's geographic location is highly suitable for business and pleasure alike. Vienna's proximity to outdoor recreation—skiing, hiking and water sports—makes for an ingrained environmental appreciation and awareness. And outdoor activities are not the only fun to be had: it has also become a fast-growing, young and lively city over the past decade with it's high density of students.
