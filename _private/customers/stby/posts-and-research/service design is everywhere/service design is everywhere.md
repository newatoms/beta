# Service Design is Everywhere

I am often surprised by how my behaviour, while interacting with something I know very well, has changed by the influence of an investment in service design. A fantastic example of this is the library. It is a place that has been traditionally known for "shushing" people, requiring heaping mounds of paperwork in order to benefit from their services, penalizing slow readers with fines, and being staffed with busy and sometimes intimidating people.

If you've visited a library recently, perhaps you sensed something different going on. Most libraries have recognised that they no longer have a product; they are all about an experience. Currently, they are not in the business of books but the business of learning. They are working to understand the learning needs of communities and how to translate those needs into service and experiences for customers.

Values defined by librarians have transformed into values defined by library users. Almost everything they do is about either helping people accomplish a task (preparing children to read, providing a space for families, supporting job-seekers and entrepreneurs) or curating an experience (providing entertainment, organising events and exhibitions, creating communities based on common interests). They have gone from silent, dusty and intimidating to welcoming, helpful, fresh and fun.

## Helping staff and travelers effectively anticipate train departure times.

Another place that has improved greatly due to service design is the train station. I always travel by train during rush hours. I find myself sprinting through the stations’ big halls, high heels tapping on tiles, cafe latte in one hand in search of the right platform. Enduring stress before even thinking about work is not ideal. But then — while looking for the departure time of my train — I see a count down clock. I don't even even have to look at my watch. Three minutes until the train leaves. Time to take a deep breath and see if I spilled any of my coffee.     

Delays in train departures from stations are disruptive to many, "such as train travelers and staff working in trains and stations, but also others stuck in traffic waiting needlessly at a nearby crossing."
Train operators are keen to explore solutions that help to avoid delays in dispatch times, and one such solution is a count down service. A digital sign at the platform showing the minutes and seconds left before a train is due to depart helps staff and travelers effectively anticipate train departure times." Though implementation of such a system may be barely-noticed, this subtle improvement greatly improves the service of transportation.

By taking away the stress of catching my train, or the uneasiness or going to the library i can pay attention to other matters that are important form me, and my loved ones. Even though these changes seem trivial, the development of brilliant ideas that stimulate our society happen only when there is space for them to exist. 

Well-designed and intentional yet often unnoticed or taken-for-granted services make our daily lives, and that of those around us, smoother and more comfortable creating space for other things to come into existence.
