# Service Design is Everywhere

I am often surprised by how my behaviour, while interacting with something I know very well, has changed by the influence of an investment in service design. A fantastic example of this is the library. It is a place that has been traditionally known for "shushing" people, requiring heaping mounds of paperwork in order to benefit from their services, penalizing slow readers with fines and being staffed with busy and sometimes intimidating people.

If you've visited a library recently, perhaps you sensed something different going on. Most libraries have recognised that they no longer have a product; they are all about an experience. Currently, they are not in the business of books but the business of learning. They are working to understand the learning needs of communities and how to translate those needs into service and experiences for customers. In other words, they have started taking their service design seriously.

Values defined by librarians have transformed into values defined by library users. Almost everything they do is about either helping people accomplish a task (preparing children to read, providing a space for families, supporting job-seekers and entrepreneurs) or curating an experience (providing entertainment, organising events and exhibitions, creating communities based on common interests). They have gone from silent, dusty and intimidating to welcoming, helpful, fresh and fun environments.

Well-designed and intentional yet often unnoticed or taken-for-granted services make our daily lives smoother and more comfortable. Our interactions with organisations are actually services that can be designed. When those experiences are negative, STBY sees opportunities for improvement. STBY has worked to improve society, often times in subtle but highly impactful ways.

## Helping staff and travelers effectively anticipate train departure times.

Let's look at another place that has improved greatly due to service design: the train station. Nomi always travels by train during rush hours. She finds herself sprinting through the stations’ big halls, high heels tapping on tiles, cafe latte in one hand in search of the right platform. Enduring stress before even thinking about work is not ideal. But then — her eyes scanning for her train departure time — she sees a count down clock. She didn't even have to look at her watch. Three minutes until the train leaves. Time to take a deep breath while finding out she didn’t spill any coffee; today will be a good day.     

Delays in train departures from stations are disruptive to many, "such as train travelers and staff working in trains and stations, but also others stuck in traffic waiting needlessly at a nearby crossing. Train operators are keen to explore solutions that help to avoid delays in dispatch times, and one such solution is a count down service. A digital sign at the platform showing the minutes and seconds left before a train is due to depart helps staff and travelers effectively anticipate train departure times." Though implementation of such a system may be barely-noticed, this subtle improvement greatly improves the service of transportation.

"Policy changes, ageing society, rising costs and digitisation… these are just a few of the challenges the healthcare sector faces today. As the complexity of the system and services increases, regular problem-solving methods don’t fit anymore." When a healthcare organisation realised this was an imminent problem, they wanted to introduce Design Thinking to their employees and asked us at STBY to help them with that process. Teaching healthcare employees to think in solution-focused, action-oriented ways opens doors to creativity in the field, accelerating much-needed improvements and changes.
