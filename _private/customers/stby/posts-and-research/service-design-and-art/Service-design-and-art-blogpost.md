# How service design influences the way we perceive art

Almost everything we touch and see on a daily basis is created by other people, usually with a very specific goal in mind. Often these goals seem obvious, for example how a glass enables you to consume a liquid without needing to drink straight from the source.

At the same time this glass also influence the way you consume the liquid. A person drinkin milk from a expensive crystal glass will drink and experience th milk differently than a person drinking the exact sam milk from a bucket. Everyone is aware of the practical side of things, because drinkin milk from a glass is much more preferred than drinking it from your cupped hands, but we are much less aware of the influence the choice of glass has on the way we drink our milk.

The moment you start paying attention to the influence objects have on the way you use them, a whole new world opens up.

In this article we would like to use art as a example of how the way it is presented influences the way you experience it. Just as much as the shape and material of the glass influences the way you drink you milk.
