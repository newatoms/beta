# What it is about Bas and Geke that made STBY so good.

Geke and Bas, co-founders of STBY, have both been working in the internet and media sectors for nearly two decades. They've been pioneers in emerging technologies research since the world wide web became mainstream in the early nineties. Co-founding and developing a successful media research company (which was snatched up by Lost Boys International) was not adequate, so they returned to university to study the way people interact with their environments. In 2002, STBY was born. Geke is now the Strategy Director and Bas the Creative Director, both guiding a team of highly creative service designers and researchers.

Experience alone, however, does not automatically determine that a person will shine in a particular field. They must have something else—a particular personality trait or an innate motivation—that drives them.

Geke and Bas have that "something else".
