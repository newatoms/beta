# Service Design According to STBY

## It begins with *design research*

### What is *design research*?
Design research is "research into people's behaviours and motives that is integrated into the design and development of new products, services and systems".

### Why is it important?
"The integration of understanding through research with creation through design accelerates innovation and is particularly valuable when a company wants to explore the potential of new areas with many unknowns."

## Things *design research* does based on STBY's FAQs:

* Aims to make a meaningful, valuable difference in people's lives
* Steps into the shoes of its research participants

* Integrates the people who will use future products and services in the creation of these products and services
