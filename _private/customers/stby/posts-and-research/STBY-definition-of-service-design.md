# Service Design According to STBY

## It begins with *design research*

### What is *design research*?
Design research is "research into people's behaviours and motives that is integrated into the design and development of new products, services and systems".

### Why is it important?
"The integration of understanding through research with creation through design accelerates innovation and is particularly valuable when a company wants to explore the potential of new areas with many unknowns."

## Things *design research* does based on STBY's FAQs:

* Explores an entirely new area, as opposed to *qualitative marketing research* which is mostly used to test people’s response to already designed products or services

* Aims to make a meaningful, valuable difference in people's lives

* Steps into the shoes of its research participants

* Integrates the people who will use future products and services in the creation of these products and services

* Is participant-driven

* Listens to people's stories

* Bases its conclusions on people's stories

* Doesn't attempt to quantify behaviour

* Asks open-ended questions

* Remains open to unexpected answers

* Uses tangible artefacts like maps, labels and diaries in the process of gathering research

* Uses video to communicate people's stories and see the untold

* Aims to create an overview of existing behaviour around a certain topic

* Connects organisations (their clients) with the lives and experiences of these organizations' customers (their "participants")

## Examples of *service design* engaged in by STBY

* Training business-minded professionals to shift to a design-thinking approach in order to become less systematic and linear and more solution-focused and action-oriented

* Exploring the behaviour and needs of car drivers with the aim to identify new solutions beyond increasing the road infrastructure

* Engaging in an extensive series of interactions with cyclists at different train stations in large cities around the country, highlighting the key issues and opportunities for improvement in order to optimise the service experience of parking your bike

* Facilitating an information exchange between the government and the market on plant protection, resulting in a detailed and visual overview of the activities and experiences of farmers throughout the year in relation to the use of plant protection treatments and sharing the documentation on this usage with both professional stakeholders and the wider society

* Embracing that people’s behaviour is diverse and complex, investigating it with the right analytical tools, and delivering the emerging materials and opportunities in the most impactful way while evaluating new Google products
