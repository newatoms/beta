# How Service Design Is Used in the Presentation of Art


Imagine the following scenarios:

*You are in the Rijksmuseum early in the morning. It's quiet. You are standing alone in front of Rembrandt's* [Night Watch](http://www.rembrandthuis.nl/media/images/nachtwachtrh.jpeg). *While looking at the painting, you're also aware of the surrounding architecture, the quality of light, the smell of the gallery, the feel of the carpet beneath your feet.*

*You are sitting in a café with a friend. Music is playing. You are flipping through a guide of Amsterdam, where you come across a picture of Rembrandt's* Night Watch *between a photo of the Red Light District and a picture of Van Gogh's* Sunflowers, *all surrounded by text.*

In each scenario, how do you experience the painting?

In 1972, art critic/writer/painter/poet [John Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Berger), in tandem with the BBC, made a four-part television series called *[Ways of Seeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utEoRdSL1jo)*. In this series, Berger calls a painting "a corridor, connecting the moment which it represents, to the moment you are looking at it."

This metaphor is now more relevant than ever. Most of our experiences looking at art outside of a museum are through multiple subsequent lenses: a photo taken of the original, then uploaded onto a computer from which it is posted on a website, to where it finally reaches us, in illuminated pixels or ink on a page, wherever we may be at that moment. It comes to us as information. Our experience of it, therefore, is entirely affected by context.

Our location, company, and what our other senses are simultaneously experiencing all contribute to our experience of a work of art outside of a museum. But these are only the factors over which we have control. Berger argues that "reproduction of works of art can be used by anybody for their own purposes." Manipulation—cropping, panning, overlying music, placement among text or other images—all transform the narrative of an artwork.

Manipulation and transformation are not inherently negative. Works of art can enhance the everyday experiences of commuting, leafing through a magazine, occupying an office space...       Visiting a museum is a luxury. It regulates the environment to place the visitor into ideal art viewing circumstances. This is service design. Out in the world, context is shaping our behaviour and perceptions. The context of an artwork, or rather the reproduction thereof—think Google Images, Pinterest, advertising—is equally as designed for a specific effect.
