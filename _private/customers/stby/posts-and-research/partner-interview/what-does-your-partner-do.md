# What does your partner do? About Stby employee: Marie de Vos

How do you tell your friends what your partner does? Is this always a coherent story?  

## How did you guys meet?

We both did a media technology master in Leiden, it was there where we meet. We both came from a very different background. Marie had here psychology bachelor and I studied multi-media and design. We were taking the same classes and it was in Leiden where we fell in love.

## So, Marie took a more social side and you a more technical?

The idea behind the master was that it didn't matter what kind of background you had. You could add and use your own expertise in all the classes. You learned a lot about creative ways to do research and at the same time, technological abilities got updated. There was something there for everyone.

## What is the difference between the two of you when it comes to doing research?

Because of her psychological background she has way more experience in doing research than me. Where she is very precise and more scientifically based, I'm more practical. Analysing human behaviour really is a strong skill she has. She's also really good in taking ownership of a project and deliver with a very high quality, she's realy persistant and thrives to perfection.

That last part couldn't be more different than me. I'm more practical and finish things in a quicker, I'm very quick in saying: well, this is it, it's good enough lets go on!
