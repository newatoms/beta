# What does my boyfriend think I do?

> An interview with the partner of one of our service designers.

It is sometimes hard to explain what we do--especially to those who are not familiar with our field of work--which is sad because what we do can have a big impact on everyday life. At times this is visible, at times invisible. To figure out how we would go about explaining what we do, we asked the people closest to us how they see us. In this article we interview Thijs de Boer, front-end developer at marktplaats.nl about his girlfriend Marie de Vos, design researcher at Stby Amsterdam (see her Stby profile [here](http://www.stby.eu/2010/02/22/marie-de-vos/)).  

## How do you explain what Marie does to friends in a pub?

I always start at a high level by saying that she's a researcher. Then I narrow it down by telling that she's not a typical market-researcher, but that she researches how services of companies are being used, then detecting potential opportunities. I also always tell them that the result of the research is not a dusty, boring report of sixty pages. The results are always presented visually in videos or infographics--something creative that will translate the research to their customers in an understandable product.

Service design is a very abstract term for most people. I always stay away from that one. The projects they do are very versatile and different from one another. But what they have in common are that they always solve problems creatively and find ways to improve services.  

## How did you guys meet?

We both did a media technology Master in Leiden. We both came from a very different background. Marie had her psychology Bachelor and I studied multi-media and design. We were taking the same classes and it was in Leiden where we fell in love.

## So, Marie took a more social road and you planned a more technical future?

The idea behind the Master was that it didn't matter what kind of background you had. You could add and use your own expertise in all the classes. We learned a lot about creative ways to do research and at the same time, our technological abilities got updated. There was something there for everyone.

## What is the difference between the two of you when it comes to doing research?

Because of her psychological background, she has way more experience in doing research than me. Where she is very precise and more scientifically-based, I'm more practical. Analysing human behaviour really is a strong skill she has. She's also really good in taking ownership of a project and delivering a very high quality. She's really persistent and thrives for perfection.

That last part couldn't be more different than me. I'm more practical and finish things in a quicker fashion. I'm very quick in saying: this is it, it's good enough, next! She could learn from me as well. Sometimes she wants things to be almost too perfect. It's hard to pinpoint what she could learn, but yes that would be it. Sometimes you have to kill your darlings and go on or say: now it's good enough.

## What did you learn from her?

Apart from the organising and perfectionistic part, she knows how to tackle and solve a problem. I admire her for that. Together with others she knows how to solve problems and find creative solutions. I try to adopt those skills in my own work. Stby talks a lot with the users of the service they are researching. That is a huge part of their research. I work at quite a large company, cozy and save in an office. Marie goes out there to talk to users without any pre-assumptions, they find stories and with that they will work out solutions for certain stories. This is also something what I would want to do more and which I admire.      

## Is there something you can point out in her daily live that she does at work?

Marie is very organised. She has lists of everything, luckily there are no coloured post-its yet to write it on. You can safely assume that our holidays are well planned!   

From a user-research perspective she has this thing that when she's on the train, strangers tell their life stories to her very easily. All kinds of drama, I mean incurable illnesses, really personal stuff. That's why I think she's good in what she does.
