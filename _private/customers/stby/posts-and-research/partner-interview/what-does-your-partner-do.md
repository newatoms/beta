# What does your partner do? About Stby employee: Marie de Vos

How do you tell your friends what your partner does? Is this always a coherent story? Service design, design research, user experience, you probably won't get away with dropping these terms. In this first article we interview Thijs de Boer who's the partner of Marie de Vos, design researcher at Stby Amsterdam.    

## How did you guys meet?

We both did a media technology master in Leiden, it was there where we meet. We both came from a very different background. Marie had here psychology bachelor and I studied multi-media and design. We were taking the same classes and it was in Leiden where we fell in love.

## So, Marie took a more social road and you planned a more technical future?

The idea behind the master was that it didn't matter what kind of background you had. You could add and use your own expertise in all the classes. You learned a lot about creative ways to do research and at the same time, technological abilities got updated. There was something there for everyone.

## What is the difference between the two of you when it comes to doing research?

Because of her psychological background she has way more experience in doing research than me. Where she is very precise and more scientifically based, I'm more practical. Analysing human behaviour really is a strong skill she has. She's also really good in taking ownership of a project and deliver with a very high quality, she's really persistent and thrives for perfection.

That last part couldn't be more different than me. I'm more practical and finish things in a quicker fashion, I'm very quick in saying: this is it, it's good enough, lets go on!

## What did you learn from her?

Apart from the organising and perfectionistic part she knows how to tackle and solve a problem. I admire her for that. Together with others she knows how to solve problems and find creative solutions. I try to adopt those skills in my own work. Stby talks a lot with the users of the service they are researching. That is a huge part of their research. I work at quite a large company save in an office.    

## How do you explain what Marie does for a living to friends in a pub?

I always start at a high level by saying that she's a researcher. Then I narrow it down by telling that she's not a typical market-researcher, but that she researches how services of companies are being used. Detecting potential opportunities. I also always tell them that the result of the research is not a dusty boring report of sixty pages. The results are always visual presented in video or infographics, something creative which will translate the research to their customers who will make a the physical product.

Service design is a very abstract term for most people I always stay away from that one.

The projects they do are very versatile and different from one another. But what they have in common are that they always sole problems creatively and
