# Marie de Vos’ boyfriend explains what she does at STBY

> An interview with the partner of one of our service designers.

It is sometimes hard to explain what we do – especially to those who are not familiar with our field of work – which is sad because what we do can have a big impact on everyday life. At times this is visible, other times it's not. To figure out how we would go about explaining what we do, we asked the people closest to us how they see us.

For this article we interviewed Thijs de Boer about his girlfriend Marie de Vos, design researcher at STBY Amsterdam.  

## How do you explain to your friends in the pub what Marie does?

When Thijs tries to explain to his friends exactly what his girlfriend does, he usually starts by telling them she is a researcher at STBY. "She's not a typical market-researcher, but she researches how services of companies are being used." Because it is difficult to understand what service design actually is, he usually tells his friends that she tries to figure out how services can be improved by investigating the behavior of the users.

Thijs tells his friends that "the research is not a boring report of sixty pages," but that the results are always presented visually in videos or infographics: "something creative that will translate the research to their customers in an understandable product." There is not a set way to do service design, which makes it hard to pinpoint what it is. "The projects they do are very different from one another, but always get solved by STBY in the same way: by creatively finding ways to improve services."

## How did you guys meet?

Thijs en Marie met while both following a media technology Master in Leiden. They both came from very different backgrounds but followed the same classes. Marie had just recieved her psychology Bachelor and Thijs had studied multi-media and design.

The Media Technology master is a place where students get encouraged to create products inspired by their own personal needs and experiences. The idea behind this learning process is the belief that new scientific insights are encountered by doing and creating. "We learned a lot of creative ways to do research while improving our technological abilities." This master contributed greatly towards Marie's ability to understand both the designer and the end user, something which is crucial for being a good service designer.

## What is the difference between you two in research?

"Because of her psychological background, she has way more experience in doing research. She is very precise and scientifically-based, I'm more practical. This has a lot to do with perfectionism and her capability to take ownership of a project and how she strives for perfection", something that Thijs greatly admires. "This couldn't be more different than me, I'm more practical and finish things in a quicker fashion." Even though Thijs would love to be as dedicated as Marie, he also sees a problem in her perfectionism. "She wants things to be almost too perfect, Sometimes you have to kill your darlings and go on or say: now it's good enough."

"Apart from the organising and perfectionistic part, she knows how to tackle and solve a problem, I admire her for that." Together with the others [other STBY employees] Marie knows how to solve problems and find creative solutions. Thijs tries to adopt those skills into his own work. "I work at quite a large company, cosy and save in an office. Marie goes out there to talk to users without any pre-assumptions. At STBY they find stories and with those they will work out solutions for certain problems. This is also something what I would want to do more."

## What makes Marie good at what she does?

"Analyzing human behavior really is a strong skill she has." From a user-research perspective she has a great personal talent for reassuring the people and giving them the freedom to open up. "When she's on the train, strangers tell their life stories to her very easily, really personal stuff". The ability to connect with people on a personal level is very important for service design in order to figure out what a user actually needs. This is what makes Marie such a great service designer, and the "organising and perfectionistic part" of course.
