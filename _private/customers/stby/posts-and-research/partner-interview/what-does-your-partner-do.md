# What does my boyfriend think I do?

> An interview with the partner of one of our service designers.

It is sometimes hard to explain what we do –especially to those who are not familiar with our field of work– which is sad because what we do can have a big impact on everyday life. At times this is visible, at times invisible. To figure out how we would go about explaining what we do, we asked the people closest to us how they see us.

In this article we interviewed Thijs de Boer about his girlfriend Marie de Vos, design researcher at Stby Amsterdam.  

# How do you explain to your friends in the pub what Marie does?

When Thijs try's to explain to his friends in the pub what his girlfriend exactly does, he usually starts by telling them she is a market researcher. "she's not a typical market-researcher, but she researches how services of companies are being used", that she uses the insights on how these services are being used to figure out how they can be improved by incorporating the behavior of the users.

Thijs always tells his friends that "the research is not a dusty, boring report of sixty pages." but that the results are always presented visually in videos or infographics "something creative that will translate the research to their customers in an understandable product". There is not a set way to do service design, which makes it hard to pinpoint down what it is. "The projects they do are very versatile and different from one another. But what they have in common are that they always solve problems creatively and find ways to improve services."

## How did you guys meet?

Thijs en Marie met while both following a media technology Master in Leiden. They both came from a very different backgrounds, but followed the same classes. Marie had just recieved her psychology Bachelor and Thijs had studied multi-media and design. "We were taking the same classes and it was in Leiden where we fell in love."

## The Media Technology master

The Media Technology master is a place where students get encouraged to create products inspired on there own personal needs and experiences from the belief that by doing and creating, new scientific insights into the underlying question are encountered. "We learned a lot about creative ways to do research and at the same time, our technological abilities got updated." This master contributed greatly towards Marie's ability to understand both the designer and the enduser, something that is crucial for being a good service designer.

## What is the difference between you two in research?

"Because of her psychological background, she has way more experience in doing research, she is very precise and scientifically-based, I'm more practical." This has a lot to with perfectionism and capability to take ownership of a project and how she strives for perfection, something that Thijs greatly admires. "That couldn't be more different than me. I'm more practical and finish things in a quicker fashion." Even tough would love to be as dedicated as Marie, he also sees a problem in her perfectionism. "she wants things to be almost too perfect, Sometimes you have to kill your darlings and go on or say: now it's good enough."

## What have you learned from her?

"Apart from the organising and perfectionistic part, she knows how to tackle and solve a problem. I admire her for that." Together with others Marie knows how to solve problems and find creative solutions. Thijs try's to adopt those skills in his own work. "I work at quite a large company, cosy and save in an office. Marie goes out there to talk to users without any pre-assumptions. They find stories and with that they will work out solutions for certain stories. This is also something what I would want to do more and which I admire."

# What makes Marie good at what she does?

"Analyzing human behavior really is a strong skill she has." From a user-research perspective she has a great personal talent of reassuring the people and giving them the freedom to open up. "When she's on the train, strangers tell their life stories to her very easily. All kinds of drama– I mean incurable illnesses, really personal stuff". The ability to connect with the needs of a user on a personal level is very important (and hard) if you want to figure out what it actually is that a user needs. Quite often people speak to fulfill the expectations of others, instead of finding out what it is that they need. Marie's capability to make the people she talks to feel save and heard enables them to let go of their expectations and truly speak from their own needs. "That is why i think Marie is great at what she does"
