# What does my boyfriend think I do?

> An interview with the partner of one of our service designers.

It is sometimes hard to explain what we do –especially to those who are not familiar with our field of work– which is sad because what we do can have a big impact on everyday life. At times this is visible, at times invisible. To figure out how we would go about explaining what we do, we asked the people closest to us how they see us.

In this article we interviewed Thijs de Boer, about his girlfriend Marie de Vos, design researcher at Stby Amsterdam.  

# How do you explain to your friends in the pub what Marie does?
When Thijs try's to explain to his friends in the pub what his girlfriend exactly does, he usually starts by telling them she is a market researcher. "she's not a typical market-researcher, but she researches how services of companies are being used" From here he explains that she uses the insights on how these services are being used to figure out how they can be improved by incorporating the behavior of the users.

Thijs usually has a hard time explaining to his friends that "the research is not a dusty, boring report of sixty pages." but that the results are always presented visually in videos or infographics "something creative that will translate the research to their customers in an understandable product". There is not a set way to do service design, which makes it hard to pinpoint down what it is. "The projects they do are very versatile and different from one another. But what they have in common are that they always solve problems creatively and find ways to improve services."

## How did you guys meet?
Thijs en Marie met while both following a media technology Master in Leiden. They both came from a very different backgrounds, Marie had her psychology Bachelor and thijs studied multi-media and design. "We were taking the same classes and it was in Leiden where we fell in love."

## The Media Technology master

The Media Technology master is a place where students get encouraged to create products inspired on there own personal needs and experiences from the belief that by doing and creating, new scientific insights into the underlying question are encountered. "We learned a lot about creative ways to do research and at the same time, our technological abilities got updated." This master contributed greatly towards Marie's ability to understand both the designer and the enduser, something that is crucial for being a service designer.

## What is the difference between the two of you when it comes to doing research?

Because of her psychological background, she has way more experience in doing research than me. Where she is very precise and more scientifically-based, I'm more practical. Analysing human behaviour really is a strong skill she has. She's also really good in taking ownership of a project and delivering a very high quality. She's really persistent and thrives for perfection.

That last part couldn't be more different than me. I'm more practical and finish things in a quicker fashion. I'm very quick in saying: this is it, it's good enough, next! She could learn from me as well. Sometimes she wants things to be almost too perfect. It's hard to pinpoint what she could learn, but yes that would be it. Sometimes you have to kill your darlings and go on or say: now it's good enough.

## What have you learned from her?

Apart from the organising and perfectionistic part, she knows how to tackle and solve a problem. I admire her for that.

Together with others she knows how to solve problems and find creative solutions. I try to adopt those skills in my own work. Stby talks a lot with the users of the service they are researching. That is a huge part of their research.

I work at quite a large company, cosy and save in an office. Marie goes out there to talk to users without any pre-assumptions. They find stories and with that they will work out solutions for certain stories. This is also something what I would want to do more and which I admire.      
## Is there something you can point out in her daily life that she does at work?  

Marie is very organised. She has lists of everything. Luckily there are no coloured Post-its yet to write it on. You can safely assume that our holidays are well planned!   

From a user-research perspective she has this thing that when she's on the train, strangers tell their life stories to her very easily. All kinds of drama– I mean incurable illnesses, really personal stuff. That's why I think she's good in what she does.
