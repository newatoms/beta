Hi Ingrid!

We have edited the interview in an attempt to incorporate your feedback! We used Thijs his personal experience with Marie to draw conclusions on how good she is in service design, in order to explain the essence of service design, that the employees of STBY are good at what they do and that STBY recognizes this (making STBY at least as good as their employees in the eyes of the reader). This way (we hope) the reader will get a strong sense of what STBY does and why they are good at what they do, without having the feeling STBY is boasting. If we put the focus more on the literal aspect of what STBY does, we are afraid we will break the simpathetic-ness of the article and it will become more boasty and less effective.
