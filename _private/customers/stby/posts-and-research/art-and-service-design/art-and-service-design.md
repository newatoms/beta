In these two photos we can see the world famous "Nachtwacht" by Dutch painter Rembrand van Rijn on different walls in different places. Because of the lack of detail in the photos, both paintings can be seen as the same thing. Even tho we are in no way capable to judge the actual qualitative difference between the two painting, it is safe to say that no one looking at these two pictures will see the two paintings as qualitative equals.
