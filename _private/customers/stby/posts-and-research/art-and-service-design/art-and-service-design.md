## Context: The space the art is displayed in

In these two photos we can see the world famous "Nachtwacht" by Dutch painter Rembrand van Rijn on different walls in different places. Because of the lack of detail in the photos, both paintings can be seen as the same thing. Even tho we are in no way capable to judge the actual qualitative difference between the two painting, it is safe to say that no one looking at these two pictures will see the two paintings as qualitative equals. This is a very simplified way of illustraing how the context (in this case the room) in which you display art influences the way you persieve it.

## Context: The things that happen in the space the art is displayed in.

In these two photo's the paintings are in the same space, but within the space different things are happening. On the left photo we can see the painting being used as a context in which the "most powerful man in the world" and the prime minister of Holland meet. On the image on the right we can see a terminal ill patient seeing the the painting for the last time in her life. The reason the people are looking at the painting are completely different in both pictures, and because of it they show the paining in a total different way to the viewer of the photo. The paining in the left picture is the best and most valuable thing holland has ever produced, and stands for everything the dutch have to offer. Craftsmanship, storytelling, a rich culture, appreciation for history etc. On the right picture the painting is a portal into the soul of the painter that enables the viewer to have a bond with the creator that can console their biggest fears and give hope, ease and maybe even joy in the last moments of our lives.
