# Living the dream(ish)

Imagine how difficult it was to learn a new language a century ago. You'd have to be lucky enough for somebody who spoke the language to be living close to you and to have had the time and energy to teach you. Nowadays, sites like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) enable you to speak with somebody on the other side of the globe.

People get used to improvements so quickly that what was new a moment ago is now the norm. (Louis CK has [a pretty good sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFsOUbZ0Lr0) illustrating this during the talk show, *Conan*).

Customer satisfaction is becoming the unique selling point for services that seem more and more alike. But the difference between thinking and knowing what your users want are two vastly different things.

The spaceship *Aximo* in the Pixar film *WALL-E*, released in 2008, is a great example of this.

## Sweet, sweet Aximo

In *WALL-E*, earth is abandoned and covered in heaps of garbage left over from decades of mass-consumerism, facilitated by the megacorporation Buy 'n' Large. The same corporation evacuated Earth's population in fully-automated, luxury space cruisers, where humanity will wait until they can return to earth.

The story is told from the perspective of WALL-E, the only remaining functioning robot, tasked with cleaning up the world. At some point in the film, the viewer is introduced to one of the Buy 'n' Large starliners when WALL-E boards the spaceship *Aximo*.

As shown in [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1BQPV-iCkU), the spaceship's crew is almost entirely automised with the main goal of keeping the residents as comfortable as possible—"comfort" being defined by the consumer-driven Buy 'n' Large. A lot of these robots on Aximo already resemble existing services, or feel like they are part of a very near future.

## Aximo just got 'real' in only 7 years
 
Because WALL-E was made in 2008, it’s fascinating to see that mankind has already come this far in only 7 years. 

Take for example the very efficient, autonomously floating hovercrafts that are keeping everyone in line. Sound familiar? Look at [Google autonomous cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XReZFuACQLc) or [Tesla’s autopilot function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgNhYGAgmZo). Another phenomenon shown is one in which citizens of Aximo have peripheral vision blockers, fixing their focus only on their screens. In a way, we’re already heading this way. Just [read about this very cool design of traffic lights in Germany for smartphone zombies](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/29/always-practise-safe-text-the-german-traffic-light-for-smartphone-zombies).  

This scene from WALL-E gives us the impression that the citizens of Aximo are wasting their lives, only consuming and not contributing. But there is nothing that actually shows this. Who is to judge their productivity? While looking at the clip, it is interesting to speculate about the (fictional) motives of Buy 'n' Large based on the screenplay writers opinions of society. It stimulates us to ask whether what we *think* we or others need is *actually* what we need.
