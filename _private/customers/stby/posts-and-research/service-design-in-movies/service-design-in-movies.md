# Service design in movies
![Wall-e](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/pixar/images/c/cc/411574_170209353079235_100002705143230_215950_1399847863_o.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120104211536)

Imagine how difficult it was to learn a new language a century ago. You'd have to be lucky that somebody who spoke the language was living close to you and had time and energy to teach you. Nowadays sites like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) enable you to talk to somebody on the other side of the globe.
A large part of this transition has to do with technical innovations, but another part has to do with how these services were designed with the end-users in mind.

People get used to improvements very quickly. In a way we are just like the people on the spaceship Aximo in the movie [WALL-E](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/), oblivious to the fact how easy a lot of things have become. Good service design will become the new normal.
