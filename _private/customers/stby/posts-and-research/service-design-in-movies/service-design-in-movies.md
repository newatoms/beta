# Living the dream(ish)

Imagine how difficult it was to learn a new language a century ago. You'd have to be lucky that somebody who spoke the language was living close to you and had time and energy to teach you. Nowadays sites like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) enable you to talk to somebody on the other side of the globe.

A large part of this transition has to do with technical innovations, but another part has to do with how these services were designed with the end-users in mind.

People get used to improvements very quickly, so quickly even that something that was amazing and new just a few moments ago, now is the norm. Luis CK has [a pretty good sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFsOUbZ0Lr0) that illustrates this during the live show *Conan*.

Customer satisfaction is becoming the unique selling points for services that seem more and more alike. But the difference between thinking and knowing what your users wants, are two vastly different things.

The space ship Aximo in the Pixar movie Wall-E, released in 2008, is a great example of this.

## Sweet Sweet Aximo

In Wall-E, the earth is abandoned and covered in heaps of garbage left over from decades of mass consumerism facilitated by the megacorporation Buy 'n' Large, the same corporation that evacuated Earth's population in fully automated starliners (luxury cruiseships for in space) to cruize trough space, waiting for humanity's eventual return.

The story is told from the perspective of Wall-E, the only left functioning robot tasked with cleaning up the world. At some point in the movie the viewer is introduced to one of Buy 'n' large starliners when Wall-E boards the spaceship Aximo.

The spaceship is crewed almost entirely by robots, with their main goal to keep the residents as comfortable as possible, from the perspective of the consumer driven Buy 'n' Large.

Even though [this clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1BQPV-iCkU) gives us the impression that the citizens of Aximo are wasting their lives, only consuming and not contributing, there is nothing that actually shows this. Who is to tell what they actually do? While looking at the clip it is interesting to speculate about the (fictional) motives of the buy 'n' large and the writers of the movie. It stimulates us to ask the question if, what we think we want or others want, is actually what we need.
