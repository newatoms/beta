Imagine how difficult it was to learn a new language a century ago. You'd have to be lucky that somebody who spoke the language was living close to you and had time and energy to teach you. Nowadays sites like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) enable you to talk to somebody on the other side of the globe.
A large part of this transition has to do with technical innovations, but another part has to do with how these services were designed with the end-users in mind.

People get used to improvements very quickly, so quickly even that something that was a mazing and new just a few moments ago, now is the norm. Luis CK has [a pretty good sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFsOUbZ0Lr0) that illustrates this during the live show "Conan".

Just like offering WIFI in an airplain, custumer satisfaction is becoming more and more the unique selling points for servicese that seem more and more alike. But thinking that you know what your users want, and knowing it are two vastly different things.

The pace ship Aximo in the Pixar movie Wall-E, released in 2008, is a great example of this.  

## Sweet Sweet Aximo

Wall-E is a movie
In 2008 Pixar released the movie Wall-E. In 2805, Earth is abandoned and covered in heaps of garbage left over from decades of mass consumerism facilitated by the megacorporation Buy 'n' Large (BnL). Seven hundred years earlier, BnL evacuated Earth's population in fully automated starliners, leaving behind WALL-E trash compactor robots to clean the planet for humanity's eventual return.

At some point in the movie the viewer is introduced to one of Buy 'n' large starliners when Wall-E boards the space ship Aximo.

Designed as a massive luxury cruise ship, the Axiom kept everyone aboard fed and entertained as it cruised through space, waiting until they could return to earth.

The ship is crewed almost entirely by robots, though there is a human captain. The majority of the ship's functions are handled by its computer, as well as an autopilot called AUTO. The ship has all the trappings of a typical cruise liner, such as shops, restaurants and swimming pools.

To make sure that the wait to return to earth is as pleasant as possible, every single part of the ship is designed to ward passenger comfort, from the perspective of a benefactor of consumerism, Buy 'n' large.
