# How could we find out what the long term effects of service design are?

At STBY we evaluate a lot with clients, but outsiders seldom get the change to see that what we do is there for the long run. After working with clients intensively, we often go our seperate ways. This time we want to look at what kind of impact STBY has had on a past client. What have they learned and where are they now? What did they do with our findings? A lot of questions, but lets start with these:


* Why did you hire STBY at the time? What was the problem you wanted to solve?
* How and why did you decide to work with STBY?
* How did you experience the process?
* Can you point out some important lessons learned that helped with the improvement of your product or service?
* Do you still benefit from what STBY did?
