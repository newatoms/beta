# How could we find out what the long term effects of service design are?

We want to look at what kind of impact STBY has had on a past client. What have they learned and where are they now? We  evaluate a lot with clients but outsiders seldom get the change to see that service design is there for the long run.

* Why did you hired STBY at the time? What was the problem you wanted to solve?
* How and why did you decided to work with STBY?
* How did you experience the process?
* Can you point out some important lessons learned that helped with the improvement of your product or service?
* Do you still notice the effects of what STBY did in the time?
