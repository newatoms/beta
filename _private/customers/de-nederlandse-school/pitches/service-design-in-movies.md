# Service design in movies.

## In order to

Introduce recurring new readers to the blog who will share the story and who don't know STBY and what service design is.

## The article will need to have

 a personal relevance to the reader that they will want to share with their network.

## We propose to achieve this by

Writing an article where we use fictional services in classic blockbuster movies to explain what service design is, how it influences the experience of the fictional end users and try to understand the reason behind the way the service is designed.

## We think this is a effective method to achieve the goal because

By taking fictional services from movies we can use the emotional value the movie has for the viewer to invite them read about a subject they don't know, and probably would not actively read about. It enables create relevance to the reader by offering a new perspective on a movie they know and love, which is intensive to share the insights and article with their network.

## The effectiveness of this article is based on the following assumptions

* That people will enjoy reading insights on movies they value highly.
* That there is enough service design in movies to write about.
* That the movies we discuss offer enough context so that we can speculate on the motives of the designer of the fictional service and the experience of the end user.
