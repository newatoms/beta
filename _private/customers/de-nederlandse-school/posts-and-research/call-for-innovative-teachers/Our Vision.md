## Investigative journalism doesn’t have to take ages 

### Goal

Making journalists (new audience) and media organisations (potential editorial.supply customers) curious of the visions New Atoms has of the future in understanding the world and doing research. 

### Method

We write a blog post about the potential of **The Store** for journalism. Creating an accessible story of why and how storing the collective New Atoms knowledge (research, understanding of the world) into a hive mind will decrease the time spend on investigative journalism. 

### Assistance

Understanding the vision Boris and the New Atoms team has about the store and journalism.

### Motivation

New Atoms says that it’s partially a research organisation with collaboration—both between humans, and humans and computers—at its core. By showing the vision of that collaboration, New Atoms improves its relevance in the journalism field.
