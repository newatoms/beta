## Investigative journalism doesnâ€™t have to take ages 

### Goal

Making journalists (new audience) and media organisations (potential editorial.supply customers) curious of the visions New Atoms has for the future in understanding the world and doing research. 

### Method

We write a blog post about the potential of **The Store** for journalism. Creating an accessible story of why and how storing the collective New Atoms knowledge (research, understanding of the world) into a hive mind will decrease the time spend on investigative journalism. 

### Assistance

Understanding the vision Boris and the New Atoms team has about the store and journalism.

### Motivation

By showing the modern vision New Atoms has on understanding the world and doing research, you show your relevance and impact on the future. This blog post has the potential of attracting investors as well.
