# Teamwork makes better content

> Because we work together we can make better content, in less time. — Boris van Hoytema, Director

Most editorial work is done by individuals. This person has to come up with ideas, do research, understanding difficult concepts, decide on form of content, explain the idea on to a target audience and do all of this within a tight time-frame.

To us this seems insane.

Our team consists of members from multiple disciplines that generate pitches together. Once commissioned, each part of  content creation, e.g. research, will be done by the specialized team member. 

> Let technology do the boring parts, they never seem to be insulted, I mean not yet.. — Thomas de Beus, Content Developer

We can therefore generate all kinds of editorial content in a fast pace.
