# Teamwork makes better content

> Because we work together we can make better content, in less time. â€” Boris van Hoytema

Most editorial work is done by individuals, this means a good journalist is both good in coming up with ideas, researching, understanding them, formulating them, conveying them to the user and sharing them.

To us this seems insane.

Our teams are made up out of multiple diciplines that always work together on every bit of content created. Instead of writing our content we develop it, together.

This leads to content that is better than the sum of its parts and definetely better than what most individuals can create. Strong editorial content that works for the audience.
