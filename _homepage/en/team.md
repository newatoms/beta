# Teamwork makes for better content

> “Because we work together we can make better content, in less time.”
— Boris van Hoytema, Director

Most editorial work is done by individuals. One person has to come up with ideas, do research, understand difficult concepts, find the right form to explain them in and communicate all that he has learned to the target audience. All by himself.

To us this seems insane.

Our team consists of members from multiple disciplines and with different skill sets that create content together, from inception to publication. Making content that is crafted to strike the right chord with the audience.

> “Let technology do the boring parts, they never seem to be insulted,
I mean not yet...”
— Thomas de Beus, Content Developer

This approach allows us to create more valuable content, in considerably less time.
