# How it works

## 1. Tell us what you need
You sign up online, tell us what you want to achieve with the content, upload company style guidelines if you have them.

## 2. Pick and commission posts
Our team suggests ideas for posts, you choose which ones to commission. After this our team will start producing  and will deliver posts with writing and imagery.

## 3. You approve, the content is posted
With your approval the post is posted to your blog or Medium publication and promoted on your Twitter and Facebook.

Now go ahead, commission more posts! The posts will be produced at a frequency you choose.
