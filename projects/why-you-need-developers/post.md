# You don't need writers and illustrators anymore

The ever-changing landscape of publishing mediums and user expectations of your creative works requires editorial and advertising organisations to do both high-quality content *and* make great experiences. The problem is, **you don't do both**.

Are you in marketing? You actually don't do content. Are you from an editorial organisation? Maybe you should think more about the experience. Of course, it's more complicated than that, but let's just picture this for a moment.

## Yes, you heard, advertising is dead
In modern society advertising doesn't work anymore for most brands, we know that by now. The advertising industry is great in creating wild experiences. But [the growing popularity of ad blockers](https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/07/adblocking/) and the rise of people watching television on demand ensures advertising losing its effectiveness. Then, agencies give each other awards when creating beautiful, hip and trendy artworks which are good for their portfolios.

But when leaving out the experience, there's little research or story—read: core value—left.

Users need this backbone of practical value. Audiences have an increasing demand for immediate value from your company (hence, the growing demand for content marketing), because you have a certain expertise whether you're a product or a service.

## Content is perceived differently than it should be

On the other end, you've got editorial organisations who—[since the first newspapers arose in the 17th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_oldest_newspapers)—are specialised in producing content. Content as in finding stories, asking the right questions, gathering data and putting their efforts in writing.

News organisations excel in just that.

However, making use of [*User Experience* or *UX design*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovj4hFxko7c) techniques to tell a story in journalism is still in its infancy and often gets underestimated. While it is seen as blasphemy, yet journalists can learn from advertising and design agencies when it comes to creating a whole experience and how to convey a message to a big audience.

Content and Experience both need the same level of attention in creating an effective creative work. It's a holistic approach to modern production in either the news- and advertising industry. Content is not about choosing text, illustration, infographics, photography, video, audio or datavisualisations and leave from there—these are the tools you, as a *developer*, use to tell your story the best way possible. You use these tools to create a user experience. Rather than creating a post you create a creative work.

## You need Developers

Rather than searching for the ultimate content super hero you need *Content Developers* and *Experience Developers*. As well for creating creative works for businesses or news publications.

The *Content Developer* does everything he can to make sure every creative work has the content it needs to achieve its goals.

Activities include:

* Researching, collecting data and interviewing to find out what all the parts of a story could be.
* Mapping out these stories and structures and forming them into content.
* Researching what kind of stories the users would need to achieve their goals.
* Doing user research to find out what stories need to be told.

The Experience Developer does everything he can to make sure every creative work has the form that it needs to achieve its goals.

Activities include:

* Finding out what medium and tools fit the goals of the post best.
* Doing user research to find out which forms work well and which don't.
* Creating creative works for the greatest impact.
* Writing, drawing, photographing, filming or whatever else can make up the creative work.
* Using analytics to fine-tune creative works to the behaviour of users.
* Making sure people can find the creative works with targeted campaigns on social media.
* Understanding what social media need what approach and how they can be used to generate inbound traffic.

## The gap is in the middle

Conservatism in journalism and only trying to be the new inspiring "creative" Art Director both have their strengths, but the real value for both the sender and the receivers lies in the middle.
