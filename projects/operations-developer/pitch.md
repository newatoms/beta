## Goal
To *show how good the organisation is*, we will write about *our Vision* to show how *modern* thinking enables you to excel in *all things*, written from the perspective of a(n) *Internal Editorial Team*.

## Method
We will write an article about Boris's ideas about the importance of having happy, comfortable and cared for team members. It would be interesting to write about how, in his experience, company morale affects production, and the things he implements in order to keep his team happy.

## Example
In addition to the interview, we could write about what research and current working models inspire progressive companies like New Atoms.

## Motivation
Showing that employee happiness is important to New Atoms instills confidence in the organisation and helps to shape the way it is perceived. It tangibly demonstrates the intentional thoughtfulness of the organisation. This article could also assist in reaching potential new developers.

## Assistance
We would like to request a 30-minute interview with Boris about what models, research and ideas have inspired him, and what effect his own ideas and experiences have had on the way he runs his company in relation to his team's happiness.
