# How collaborating helps you understand the world

The way we see and understand the world is made up of an uncountable number of different experiences and perspectives, which we have gained throughout our lives and have somehow merged into our own views and opinions.

To illustrate how complicated, but also valuable this process is, I would like to discuss the many different ways in which I can experience one single phenomenon: traffic.

No matter what vehicle I am on or in, I feel like *I'm* at the center of traffic and everyone should comply to *my* rules. When I'm walking, I expect people to stop at pedestrian crossings, even though I know they don't really give pedestrians any rights in Amsterdam. When I'm on the bike I just want to get from A to B as fast as possible and everyone that is partaking in traffic is basically an idiot that's standing in the way of that goal - especially people who think they have right of way at pedestrian crossings. But then when I'm in the car I feel like both cyclists and pedestrians are hazardous, because they are unpredictable projectiles that don't follow the rules - rules that would make traffic safe, if only everyone would comply to these rules.

You might think I'm schizophrenic as f*ck. However, I like to see this as an example of how I can see things from different perspectives using only myself. Imagine the perspectives and insights I could gain by getting to know other people's perspectives.

We all have our own worldview. We can try to imagine how somebody else sees the world but this will always be warped by our own ideas and experiences. People are, however, pretty good at upgrading their knowledge when confronted with inconsistencies, obtaining new insights or learning new facts. The most effective method for upgrading knowledge is by actively cooperating with others. In such a situation, you have to focus your discussion on a certain topic, use constructive arguments, and explain your thought process step by step. When approaching unfamiliar topics, you often notice that you are struggling with making claims or backing them up. These moments are very valuable because they show a gap in your knowledge and let you fill that gap by "stealing" the knowledge of others.

## You only need skilled and talented people. Guess again!

A lot of companies think they will prosper most when there is competition between colleagues. Those who want to prove they're are better than others and therefor hoping for a raise. Already feeling stressed reading this?

Turns out, relying solely on combining the most talented people is not the way to go. Charles Duhigg of the New York Times wrote in [What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=1) that the best performing teams were all about **psychological safety**. Google's research showed that this component enables team members to take risks. In addition, it's also important to feel safe in a group to open up to team mates and explain your doubts.

Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division said in the article: "We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter."
