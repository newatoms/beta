# How collaborating helps you understand the world

World views are made up of a countless number of experiences and perspectives gained throughout a life. People easily switch between these views, as can be seen in traffic:

No matter what vehicle we are on or in, we feel like *we're* at the center of traffic and everyone should comply to *our* rules. When we're on a bike, we just want to get from A to B as fast as possible. Everyone partaking in traffic is basically an idiot that's standing in the way of that goal. But when we're in the car, we feel like both cyclists and pedestrians are hazardous because they are unpredictable projectiles that don't follow the rules—rules that would make traffic safe, if only everyone would comply to these rules.

> The most effective method for upgrading knowledge is by actively cooperating with others

So we ourselves can easily switch, but we also try to imagine how others see the world—this will always be warped by our own ideas and experiences though. When experiencing a different perspective we are pretty good at upgrading our knowledge, for example when confronted with inconsistencies, obtaining new insights or learning new facts. The most effective method for upgrading knowledge is by actively cooperating with others, because it easily lets us experience a different view.

In addition, in such a situation you have to focus your discussion on a certain topic, use constructive arguments, and explain your thought process step by step. When approaching unfamiliar topics, you therefore often notice that you are struggling with making claims or backing them up. These moments are very valuable because they show a gap in your knowledge and let you fill that gap by "stealing" the knowledge of others.

## It's all about **psychological safety**

We feel this is exactly the reason Google found out that the best performing teams were all about **psychological safety**. Their research, in which they analyzed how their teams were functioning, showed that this component enables team members to take risks and explain their doubts. Charles Duhigg of the New York Times wrote a piece about it: [What Google Learned From wets Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=1).

Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division said in the article: "We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter."
