### Goal

To stimulate curiosity about the New Atoms' vision of doing research in order to understand the world.

### Method

We will write about the potential of **The Store** for journalism, creating an accessible story about why and how storing
the collective New Atoms knowledge into a hive mind could revolutionise investigative journalism.

### Assistance

A short conversation about the vision of Boris and the New Atoms team regarding the store and journalism.

### Motivation

New Atoms claims to be partially a research organisation with collaboration—both between humans, and humans and
computers—at its core. By showing the vision of that collaboration, New Atoms improves its relevance in the journalism field.
