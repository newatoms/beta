# Robots can Have our Jobs

## Goal
To *show the organisations impact on the future*, we will write about *New Atoms' Vision* to show how *modern* implementations enables the organization to excel in *research and understanding*, written from the perspective of a(n) *Internal Editorial Team*.

## Method
We will write an article about automation, what it can do for us, how it frees us to do things AI cannot yet do and why New Atoms believes they should automate most things that are automatable.

## Example
We could write about the things we automate and how we do not feel our jobs are actually at risk as a result of AI, but rather that developments in AI free us to do the more fun and creative things that computers are not yet capable of doing.

## Motivation
Writing about the progressive mindset of New Atoms and its participation in and contributions to the fast-flowing river of technology shows that the organization is forward-thinking. Companies that aware of what is happening in technology and actively using these resources are actually directing the future.

## Assumptions
That New Atoms would in fact automate most things possible.
