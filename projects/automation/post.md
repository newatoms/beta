It is speculated on the internet that Einstein once wrote: "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Regardless of who wrote it, our bushiness developer once again learned its inevitable truth a few months back when he was renovation his home with his father. "At some point is was failing miserably to unfasten a bunch of nifty screws while my father was trying to break trough a plaster wall with the efficiency of a new born calf. I remember being on the verge of tears when my father (in a similar state) suggested to switch places. Not only did I fly trough the walls with the pleasure and ease that already had me tearing out the rotten floorboards, my father was already halfway trough fixing the lighting issues I was having because he like the challenge these little screws offered."

This and many other shared experiences has left us at New Atoms striving to break up and formulate all our tasks in such a way that our developers always only have to pick up tasks that they enjoy. Now we are left with the challenge of solving all the left over tasks. Our next attempt,  automation.
