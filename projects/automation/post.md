The robots are taking over and we are happy that it does. Happy because they will make our working and personal lives easier and more fun. Why not let people do the creative thinking and let technology do the boring parts, they never seem insulted (not yet…). 

The world would be a happier, more fluid and communal place if robots did all the jobs they can do better than people?

It is speculated on the internet that Einstein once wrote: 

> ”Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." 

Regardless of who wrote this, we have all experienced its truth when we've had to do things we were bad at. We have experienced it at school, at our first jobs and probably in all aspects of life.

If you are bad at something and you don't seem to get better at it, no matter your efforts, you usually do an even worse job than you are capable of. But if you enjoy doing something and see yourself getting better at it, you will often exceed expectations.

This suggests that people are more efficient when they do what they enjoy and can improve in. It also means that there is something beyond the [carrot and the stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick). It speaks of the power of motivation through happiness and self fulfilment instead of motivation through fear or rewards. You might even go as far as to conclude that if everyone does the things they enjoy and has the opportunity to develop themselves, their contribution to society will be maximised.

But of course, there are always tasks that nobody wants to do—tasks you just can't get better at, that are repetitive and have predetermined goals with inflexible solutions. Tasks that don't need creativity, only execution. So to who do you assign those tasks? Robots!

# Automation
Robots are amazing at following instructions with inhuman precision while humans are great at coming up with the instructions. Humans are great at creation while robots are superior at execution.

Automation is not only good for doing certain things more efficiently than people, it is a great way to make sure that no one needs to have a job they hate.

Of course this will not be achieved overnight. Those whose jobs would be automated would need time to rediscover what they enjoy and are good at. We should not just fire everyone who has a job better suited for robots, but we should look to automation for the future workforce. What if humans only had to do jobs they enjoy and the rest done by robots?

Imagine a world where you would constantly be stimulated to come up with smart, fun and social solutions. Imagine a world where we only had to do constructive, creative things. Nothing would ever come to a standstill. Systems would become fluid and communal and each individual could influence the world around them with their own strengths and beliefs.
