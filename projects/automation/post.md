The robots are taking over and we should be happy they are. Happy because they will make our working and personal lives more fun. Why not let people do the creative thinking and let technology do the boring parts? Robots never seem insulted (not yet anyway...).

It is speculated on *the internet* that Einstein once wrote:

> Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.

Regardless of who wrote this, we have all experienced its truth when we've had to do things we were bad at. We have experienced it at school, at our first jobs and probably in all aspects of life.

Fact is that we just can't be good in everything. When we try hard to improve our weaknesses, no matter the efforts, we usually fail. But if you enjoy doing something and see yourself improve, you will often exceed expectations.

This suggests that people are more efficient when they do what they enjoy and can improve at. It also means that there is something beyond the [carrot and the stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick). It speaks of the power of motivation through happiness and self fulfillment instead of motivation through fear or rewards. You might even go as far as to conclude that if everyone does the things they enjoy and has the opportunity to develop themselves, their contribution to society will be maximised.

## Human vs. robots

But of course, there are always tasks that nobody wants to do—tasks you just can't get better at, that are repetitive and have predetermined goals with inflexible solutions. Tasks that don't need creativity, only execution. So who do you assign those tasks to? Robots!

Robots are amazing at following instructions with inhuman precision while humans are great at coming up with the instructions.

If you ask Autodesk CEO Carl Bass about the future work relationship between human workers and robots you'll find a strong prediction:

> “The factory of the future will have only two employees: a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment.”

See what an awesome job this robot is doing. Imagine having to split all those eggs manually!

## Automation makes your job fun again

However, the power of automation is not only in doing certain things more efficiently than people, it is also in making sure that no one needs to have a job they hate.

Of course this will not be achieved overnight. Those whose jobs would be automated would need time to rediscover what they enjoy and are good at. We should not just fire everyone who has a job better suited for robots, but we should look to automation for the future workforce.

## What our future workforce looks like

It's understandable that people are afraid that they'll lose their jobs due to automation. Before we all start panicking, lets find out which future jobs will likely still be done by humans. A year ago, the BBC created [a tool where you can fill in your job title and it then calculates the *likelihood of automation*](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34066941). We immediately looked for some jobs that we're currently doing at New Atoms:

* Author, writer or translator: It's not very likely, **33%**
* Journalists, newspaper and periodical editors: It's quite unlikely, **8%**
* Programmers and software development professionals: It's quite unlikely, **8%**

It seems that we are quite save for now. On the other end the following jobs will eventually get done or solved due to technological solutions. The top 3 consists of:

1. Telephone salesperson:	**99.0%**
2. Typist or related keyboard worker:	**98.5%**
3. Legal secretary:	**97.6%**

The statistics were based on a paper done by researchers at Oxford University. The paper is called [The Future of Employment: How
Susceptible Are Jobs to
Computerisation?](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) So how did they measure this you might ask? See for yourself:

**These are the variables, used in the paper, that serve as indicators of bottlenecks to computerisation:**

There are more disadvantages that lurk beneath this creation of a techo utopia. In a way, we get dependable on technology. A couple of months ago thousands of programmers let the world know that [One programmer almost broke the internet by deleting 11 lines of code](http://uk.businessinsider.com/npm-left-pad-controversy-explained-2016-3?r=US&IR=T). It's about what happens when an open source software package gets deleted by the maker.

Podcast show Reply All from @Gimlet explains it all in their very recent episode: [#69 Disappeared](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/69-disappeared/). Although the coding world trebled a bit, they fixed the problem quite rapidly. Luckily they're in the problem solving business.

## To conclude our plea

Just imagine an automated workforce that facilitates an environment where you would constantly be stimulated to come up with smart, fun and social solutions. Looking at high scores on:

* Perception and Manipulation
* Creative Intelligence
* Social Intelligence

A future where we only have to do constructive, creative things. Nothing would ever come to a standstill. Systems would become fluid and communal and each individual could influence the world around them with their own strengths and beliefs. Wouldn't that be amazing?

At New Atoms we will probably never stop writing about the relationship between humans and machines, because we are thinking about this everyday. In an attempt to become *Humachines*.
