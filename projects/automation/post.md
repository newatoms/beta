# Robots can have our jobs

Automation has always had a pretty bad name, mainly because it seems to keep taking jobs away from good, hard working citizens. But to be completely frank, it is hard to believe that these jobs were enjoyable or challenging to begin with, mainly because the robots that are capable of taking over our jobs are those that are really good at following instructions but terrible at thinking creatively. 

Turns out the one thing we humans are super good at is creative thinking. 

We have the capability to come up with solutions that no other animal or machine canâ€”solutions that not only come from practicality, but also take other humans into account. Sadly, most of our time is spent doing jobs that don't challenge our creative side, jobs that have already-established goals with inflexible solutions.

Imagine a world where you would be constantly stimulated to come up with smart, fun and social solutions. Imagine a world where we only had to do constructive, creative things. Nothing would ever come to a standstill. Systems would become fluid and communal and each individual could influence the world around them with their own strengths and beliefs.
