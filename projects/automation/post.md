# Robots can have our jobs

The world would be a happier, more fluid and communal place if the robots took all the jobs that they could do better than people.

It is speculated on the internet that Einstein once wrote: "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Regardless of who wrote it, we have all experienced its truth when we had to do things that we where bad at. We have experienced it at school, at our first jobs and probably in all aspects of life.

If you are bad at something and you don't seem to get better at it, no matter your efforts, you usually do an even worse job than you are capable of. The other way around, If you enjoy doing something and see yourself getting better at is you will often exceed beyond expectations.

This suggests that that things will be better when people only have to do what they enjoy and can improve in, that here is something beyond the carrot and the stick. It speak of the power of motivation trough happiness and self full fillment. That If you let everyone do the things they enjoy, and give them the opportunity to develop themselves, you will maximize their contribution to society.

But off course, there are always jobs that nobody wants to do. Jobs that you just cant get better at, that are repetitive and have already-established goals with inflexible solutions. So who do you assign those jobs to? Robots!

Robots are amazing at following up instructions with inhuman precision while humans are great at coming up with instructions. Humans are great at creation while robots are superior at execution.

Automation is not only good at doing certain things more efficient that people, it is a great way to make sure that no one needs to have a job they hate.

Of course this could not be achieved overnight. The people that have the jobs that would be automized would have a really hard time rediscovering what they enjoy and are good at. We should not just fire everyone with a job better done by robots, but we should keep it in mind for all the new jobs that open up. What if we would only give the jobs to those who enjoy them and let the rest be done by robots?

Imagine a world where you would be constantly stimulated to come up with smart, fun and social solutions. Imagine a world where we only had to do constructive, creative things. Nothing would ever come to a standstill. Systems would become fluid and communal and each individual could influence the world around them with their own strengths and beliefs.
