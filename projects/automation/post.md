# Robots can have our jobs

Automation has always had a pretty bad name, mainly because it seems to keep taking away jobs from good hard working citizens. But to be completely frank, It is hard to believe that these jobs were enjoyable or challenging mainly because the robots that are capable of taking over our jobs are those that are really good at following up instructions, but are terrible in creative thinking. 

Turns out that the one thing we Humans are super good at is creative thinking. 

We have the capability to come up with solutions that no other animal or machine can. Solutions that are not only coming from practicality but also take other humans into account. Sadly most of our time is spent doing jobs that don't challenge our creative side, jobs that are very clear in what their goal is and how we are supposed to achieve them. 

Imagine a world where we would never have to do things that do not require our creativity. Imagine a world where you would be constantly stimulated to come up with smart, fun and social solutions to everything you do. Nothing would ever come to a stand still. Systems would become fluid and social and each individual could influence the world around them from their own strengths and beliefs.
