Automation has aways had a pretty bad name, mainly becouse it keeps taking a way jobs from good hard working citizents. But to be completely frank, I dont think that any of these people realy enjoyed the work they did. They had to, in order to provide and they might have enjoyed the people they where working with but it is hard to believe that the actual work apealed to them. The robots that are capable of taking over our jobs are those that are realy good at following up instructions, but are terrible in creative thinking.
Tursn out that the one thing we Humans are super good at is creative thinking. We have the capabillity to come up with solutions that no other animal or machiene can. Solotions that are not only coming from practicality but als solutions that take other humans into account. 
Sadly most of our time is spent doing jobs that dont chalange our creative side, jobs that are very clear in what their goal is and how we are suposed to achieve them. Now imagine a world where we would never have to do things that do not require our creativity. Imagine a world where you would be constantly stimulated to come up with smart, fun and social solutions to everything you do. Nothing would ever come to a stand still. Systems would be come fluid and social and every person on the planet could influenc the world around from their own personal strenths and beliefs.
