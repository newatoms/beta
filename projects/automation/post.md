It is speculated on the internet that Einstein once wrote: "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Regardless of who wrote it, our business developer once again learned its truth a few months back when he was renovation his home with his father. "At some point i was failing to unfasten a bunch of nifty screws while my father was trying to break through a plaster wall with the efficiency of a newborn calf. I remember being on the verge of tears when my father (in a similar state) suggested to switch places. Not only did I fly through the walls with the pleasure and ease that already had me tearing out the rotten floorboards, my father was already halfway through fixing the electrical issues I was having because he like the challenge these little screws offered."

Many other shared experiences like this have left us striving to break up all our tasks in such a way that our developer only have to pick up tasks that they enjoy. Now we are left with the challenge of solving all the leftover tasks. Our next attempt,  automation.
