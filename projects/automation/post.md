It is speculated on the internet that Einstein once wrote: "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Regardless of who wrote it I learn its inevitable truth once again a few months back when I was renovation my home. There was a wall that needed to be taken out, and it was a super delicate job. There were a bunch of screws that were tucked in around a corner that you could only get to with a steady hand and a LOT of patience. I have neither of those. While I was fuming away at the those little suckers my father was trying to break trough the plaster of the rest of the wall with the efficiently equivalent to a new born calf. I remember us both sweating on and persevering, our annoyance building up until i threw down my my screwdriver with i wholehearted sob not knowing what to do with the rest of my life. My father, amazing that he is, offered to switch places, seeing how that would go. Not only did i fly trough the walls with the pleasure and ease that already had me tearing out the rotten trough floorboards, my father was already halfway trough fixing the lighting issues i was having because "he like the challenge it offered". In no time most of the chores of the day where done and neither of us had the feeling we had done any hard or annoying work. By both being able to pick and enjoying the things the other would not we made the job infinity more fun and easier.

This led me to wonder how my life would be if I could always have someone within reach who enjoyed doing the things that I disliked and vice versa. How amazing our lives would be.
