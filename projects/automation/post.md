# Robots can have our jobs

It is speculated on the internet that Einstein once wrote: "Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid." Regardless of who wrote it, our business developer once again learned its truth a few months back when he was renovating his home with his father. "At some point I was failing to unfasten a bunch of nifty screws while my father was trying to break through a plaster wall with the efficiency of a newborn calf. I remember being on the verge of tears when my father (in a similar state) suggested to switch places. Not only did I fly through the walls with the pleasure and ease that already had me tearing out the rotten floorboards, my father was halfway through fixing the electrical issues I was having because he liked the challenge the little screws offered."

Many other similar shared experiences have left us striving to break up all our tasks in such a way that our developers only have to fulfill tasks they enjoy. But there are always things—those that are repetitive or monotonous—that no one wants to do. Our next attempt to get those left over tasks done: automation.

## Next station: Automation!

Automation has always had a pretty bad name, mainly because it seems to keep taking jobs away from good, hard working citizens. But to be completely frank, it is hard to believe that these jobs were enjoyable or challenging to begin with, mainly because the robots that are capable of taking over our jobs are those that are really good at following instructions but terrible at thinking creatively.

Turns out the one thing we humans are super good at is creative thinking, and that we enjoy the things most that we are good at.

People have the capability to come up with solutions that no other animal or machine can. Solutions that not only come from practicality, but also take other humans into account. Sadly, most of our time is spent doing jobs that don't challenge our creative side, jobs that have already-established goals with inflexible solutions.



Imagine a world where you would be constantly stimulated to come up with smart, fun and social solutions. Imagine a world where we only had to do constructive, creative things. Nothing would ever come to a standstill. Systems would become fluid and communal and each individual could influence the world around them with their own strengths and beliefs.
