Robots are taking over and we should be happy they are. Happy because they will make our working and personal lives more fun. Why not let people do the creative thinking and let technology do the boring parts? Robots never seem insulted (not yet anyway...).

It is speculated on *the internet* that Einstein once wrote:

> Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.

Regardless of who wrote this, we have all experienced its truth when we've had to do things we don't like. We have experienced it at school, at our first jobs and probably in most aspects of life.

The fact is that we just can't be good at everything. But the times when you enjoy doing something and see yourself improving, you will often exceed expectations.

This suggests that people are more efficient when they do what they enjoy with the possibility of improvement. It also means there is something beyond the [carrot and the stick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_and_stick). It speaks of the power of motivation through happiness and self-fulfillment rather than fear or extrinsic rewards. You might even go as far as to conclude that, if everyone was able to do the things they enjoy and had the opportunity to develop themselves, their contribution to society would be maximised.

## We're all instructors

Of course, there are always tasks that nobody wants to do—tasks at which you just can't improve, that are repetitive and have predetermined goals with inflexible solutions. Tasks that don't require creativity, only execution. So to whom do you assign those tasks? Robots!

Robots are insanely good at following instructions with inhuman precision, while humans are great at devising the instructions.

If you ask [Autodesk](http://www.autodesk.com/) CEO Carl Bass about the future work relationship between human workers and robots, you'll find a strong prediction:

> “The factory of the future will have only two employees: a man and a dog. The man will be there to feed the dog. The dog will be there to keep the man from touching the equipment.”

This might eventually apply to factories, but there are a lot of jobs (fortunately) that still need human brains.

See what an awesome job this robot is doing. Imagine having to split all those eggs manually!

## Automation makes your job fun again

The power of automation is not only in executing certain tasks more efficiently than people, it is also in creating the possibility for no one to have a job they can't stand doing.

Of course, this will not be achieved over night. Those whose jobs would be automated would need time to rediscover what they enjoy and are good at. It does not require a psychologist or economist to say that humans excel when working on something they enjoy. So rather than fearing what automation will mean for the jobs of future generations, we can be excited for the untapped potential it will reveal in humanity. Robots just may unveil our hidden talents.

## What our future workforce looks like

It's understandable that people are afraid they'll lose their jobs as a result of automation. Before we all start panicking, though, let's find out which future jobs will likely still be done by humans. A year ago, the BBC created [a tool that calculates the *likelihood of automation* for your job](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-34066941). We immediately looked for some of jobs we're currently doing at New Atoms:

* Author, writer or translator: not very likely, **33%**
* Journalists, newspaper and periodical editors: highly unlikely, **8%**
* Programmers and software development professionals: highly unlikely, **8%**

It seems we are quite safe for now. The following jobs, though, will eventually be executed with technological solutions:

1. Telephone salesperson:	**99.0%**
2. Typist or related keyboard worker:	**98.5%**
3. Legal secretary:	**97.6%**

These statistics are from researchers at Oxford University. Their study is called [The Future of Employment: How
Susceptible Are Jobs to
Computerisation?](http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) How did they measure this, you might ask? See for yourself:

**These are the variables that serve as indicators of bottlenecks to computerisation:**

Table 1 of _The Future of Employment: How Susceptable are Jobs to Ccomputerisation?_ Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne.  

Aside from needing to create new jobs, there's another disadvantage that lurks beneath the creation of a techno-utopia. In a way, we become dependant on technology. A couple of months ago, thousands of programmers let the world know that [one programmer almost broke the internet by deleting 11 lines of code](http://uk.businessinsider.com/npm-left-pad-controversy-explained-2016-3?r=US&IR=T). This type of thing becomes a real possibility when an open source software package gets deleted by the maker.

When we rely on this prolific open source world, we see how easy it is to become comfortable with automation. (Check out what @Gimlet has to say about it in their Podcast *Reply All*, episode: [#69 Disappeared](https://gimletmedia.com/episode/69-disappeared/)).  Although the coding world trembled a bit, programmers fixed the problem quite rapidly. Most important to remember (and lucky for us), is that they're in the business of solving problems.

## To conclude our plea

In spite of these "dangers"—an increasing dependability on software and the jobs that potentially get swallowed—New Atoms chooses to work *with* the robots rather than ignoring or fearing their potential. Just imagine an automated workforce that facilitates an environment in which you would constantly be stimulated to come up with smart, fun and social solutions. Let's focus on the things humans are great at:

* Perception and Manipulation
* Creative Intelligence
* Social Intelligence

If we sketch a future in which we only have to do constructive, creative things, we see that nothing would ever come to a standstill. Systems would become fluid and communal and each individual could influence the world around them with their own strengths and beliefs. Wouldn't that be amazing?

At New Atoms, we will probably never stop writing about the relationship between humans and machines because we are thinking about this everyday. In an attempt to become *Humachines*.
