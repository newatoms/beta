No one in journalism actually collaborates. We're trying to fix that.

Imagine articles that have escaped the tradition of being written by only one person (along with her or his perspectives and ego), and rather by a whole diverse team with each contributor's individual skills, views and voice.

Traditionally, producing an article goes something like this: first you find a subject, then you do some research possibly followed by an interview. After gathering all the necessary information, you start writing your article, often to discover your research is inadequate. So you do some more research and interviewing and re-write your article. Maybe you run it by a colleague, who has an idea that you implement. Then you present your work to your editor. The editor has some comments and offers perspectives you failed to think of. Annoyed by your own lack of insight, you re-write yet again and hopefully get approved for printing.

Several people have contributed to the writing process. So, collaboration, right? Nope.

## An agile way of working has helped us introduce the idea of *continuous press*.

We are trying, as a team, to build upon multiple creative works at the same time and to do it in such a way that everything is publishable after every iteration.

In this process, every little iteration a team member makes adds value to the whole. The article is continuously built upon from our different perspectives and sources until it is a well-rounded, creative work. Each addition is reviewed by someone else in a quality check. This ensures that projects are fulfilling the goals we set for them while not going outside the scope of these goals.

Think of it like this: if you had a really cool science class when you were a kid, you probably had a macaroni bridge-building challenge. Every student in your class designed and built a model of a bridge within a strict framework of rules. At the end of the contest, a heavy weight was placed on each model to test its structural integrity. Some bridges were beautiful, but collapsed immediately under the weight. Others were utter abominations but could bear the weight of a sack of bowling balls.

Now imagine the same challenge, but in a way that each bridge is only started by one student. It then goes through a rotation, allowing each student to add small parts and make small improvements based on their aptitudes. In the end, you have a much higher success rate, and kids have worked together to make better things.

## What all teams can learn from kids building macaroni bridges

This process isn't new. It's been used in software engineering for the last decade or so. These super-smart people call it *agile working*.

Agile teams first identify the goal of a project, then work on the project with the sole aim of achieving that goal. To make this possible, the goal is broken up into smaller tasks that can be fulfilled by individual team members. This way, the project keeps its momentum and every team member can choose tasks that suit her or his own strengths, quickly building upon one another's work. Even better, everyone can execute the tasks in the way they think best serves the larger goal.

By enabling team members to work on a project in the way they see fit, solutions emerge that no one individual could ever expect. Things develop from multiple perspectives. This enables teams to go beyond conventions into newer and more fruitful territories.

And this is why we feel every product that has a variable trajectory and thrives on creative freedom should use the *agile* process.

Enabling an agile workflow best situates us to use our talents within a team. We (and our work) are benefitting from the complimentary talents and insights of others, working together to deliver creative works quickly and efficiently.

All of this, if done well, makes for some very strong macaroni bridges.
