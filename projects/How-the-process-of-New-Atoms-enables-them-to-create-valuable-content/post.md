# Building Bridges

If you had a really cool science class when you were a kid, perhaps you had a bridge-building challenge. Each student in the class designs and builds a model of a bridge within a strict framework of rules. At the end of the contest, a heavy weight is placed on each model to test its structural integrity. Some bridges are beautiful, but collapse immediately under the weight. Others look like abominations but can bear the weight of a sack of bowling balls.

 Author and entrepreneur [Margaret Heffernan](http://www.mheffernan.com/index2.php) identifies that

>we have an education system that encourages people to think of themselves as soloists â€“ their success actually requires someone elseâ€™s failure.

Imagine the same challenge, but in a way that each bridge is only *started* by one student. It then goes through a rotation, allowing each student to add small parts and make small improvements based on their aptitudes. In the end, you have a much higher success rate, and kids have worked together to achieve great things.

## What all teams can learn from software development

This type of process already exists. It's called *agile* working and is mainly used in software engineering. Simply stated, *agile* teams work on projects that aim to achieve a specific goal. This goal is broken up into smaller tasks that can be fulfilled by individual team members. This way, every team member can choose tasks that suit their own strengths and experiences. They can also execute them in the way they think best serves the larger goal. By enabling team members to work on a project in the way they see fit, solutions emerge that no one individual could ever expect. This enables teams to go beyond conventions into newer and more fruitful territories.

## Traditional producing, be gone

As evidenced by the possibility of kids building bridges in small, individual iterations, *agile* working does not have to be limited to software engineering. It can also be applied to all other forms of working that benefit from collaboration.

One field that could vastly improve with better collaboration is journalism. Imagine articles not being written by one person (along with her perspectives and ego), but by a whole diverse team with each contributor's individual skills, views and voice. Doing this brings some challenges to the table. Writing text, for example, is at its core "easy" for everyone, but the task of breaking it up into small iterations is quite abstract and difficult.

Traditionally, producing an article goes something like this:

1. Finding a subject
* Doing research
* Possible interviewing
* Writing
* Some more research
* Re-writing
* Editing
* Printing

The agile way of working, however, introduces the idea of *continuous press*. In this process, every little iteration each team member makes adds value to the whole, continuously building upon it until it is a well-rounded, creative work. Each addition is reviewed by someone else in an editing step, ensuring nothing gets too crazy (unless it should ðŸ™ƒ). Ideally, the creative work should be built upon in such a way that it is publishable after every addition. This way, every article is in a constantly "finished" state.

Enabling teams to work in an agile way not only best situates people to use their talents, it also enables the team to deliver publishable, creative works in a fast and efficient way.
