# How the process of New Atoms enables them to create valuable content
If you had a really cool science class when you were a kid, perhaps you had a bridge-building challenge. Each student in the class designs and builds a model of a bridge within a strict framework of rules. At the end of the contest, a heavy weight is placed on each model to test its structural integrity. Some bridges are beautiful, but collapse immediately under the weight. Others look like abominations but can bear the weight of a sack of bowling balls.

 Author and entrepreneur [Margaret Heffernan](http://www.mheffernan.com/index2.php) identifies that

>we have an education system that encourages people to think of themselves as soloists – their success actually requires someone else’s failure.

Imagine the same challenge, but in a way that each bridge is only *started* by one student. It then goes through a rotation, allowing each student to add small parts and make small improvements based on their aptitudes. In the end, you have a much higher success rate, *and* kids have worked together to achieve great things.

At New Atoms, we don't work as individuals with large, specific tasks. We work as a team in which every member contributes small iterations to the whole. This enables us to work from our strengths instead of from necessity.

This is called *agile* working and is mainly used in software engineering. Simply stated, *agile* teams work on projects that aim to achieve a specific goal. This goal is broken up into smaller tasks that can be fulfilled by individual team members. This way, every team member can choose tasks that suit their own strengths and experiences.  They can also execute them in the way they think best serves the larger goal. By enabling team members to work on a project in the way they see fit, solutions emerge that no one individual could ever expect. This enables teams to go beyond conventions into newer and more fruitful territories.

In a way, you could say that New Atoms functions just like a pit crew. We all work from our own strengths and experiences toward the same goal, on the same project at the same time. That is why we can make really cool stuff, really well, really quickly.
