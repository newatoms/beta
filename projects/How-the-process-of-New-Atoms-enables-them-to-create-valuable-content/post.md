# Building Bridges with Macaroni

If you had a really cool science class when you were a kid, perhaps you had a macaroni bridge-building challenge. Each student in the class designs and builds a model of a bridge within a strict framework of rules. At the end of the contest, a heavy weight is placed on each model to test its structural integrity. Some bridges are beautiful, but collapse immediately under the weight. Others look like abominations but can bear the weight of a sack of bowling balls.

 Author and entrepreneur [Margaret Heffernan](http://www.mheffernan.com/index2.php) identifies that

>we have an education system that encourages people to think of themselves as soloists – their success actually requires someone else’s failure.

Imagine the same challenge, but in a way that each bridge is only *started* by one student. It then goes through a rotation, allowing each student to add small parts and make small improvements based on their aptitudes. In the end, you have a much higher success rate, and kids have worked together to achieve great things.

## What all teams can learn from kids building macaroni bridges

This type of process already exists. It's called *agile* working and is mainly used in software engineering. Simply stated, *agile* teams work on projects that aim to achieve a specific goal. This goal is broken up into smaller tasks that can be fulfilled by individual team members. This way, every team member can choose tasks that suit their own strengths and experiences. They can also execute them in the way they think best serves the larger goal. By enabling team members to work on a project in the way they see fit, solutions emerge that no one individual could ever expect. This enables teams to go beyond conventions into newer and more fruitful territories.

## Traditional producing, be gone

As evidenced by the possibility of kids building macaroni bridges in small, individual iterations, *agile* working does not have to be limited to software engineering. It can also be applied to all other forms of working that benefit from collaboration.

One field that could vastly improve with better collaboration is journalism. Imagine articles not being written by one person (along with her perspectives and ego), but by a whole diverse team with each contributor's individual skills, views and voice. Doing this brings some challenges to the table. Writing text, for example, is at its core "easy" for everyone, but the task of breaking it up into small iterations is quite abstract and difficult.

Traditionally, producing an article goes something like this: first you find a subject, then you do some research possibly followed by an interview. After gathering all the necessary information you start writing your article, often to discover you have too much information for one part of the story but not enough for another. So you go on, do some more research, interview some more people and rewrite your article. Then you go to your editor and present your work (that has more than likely not yet seen the light of day). The editor has some comments, and often offers you perspectives you failed to think of. Annoyed by your own lack of insight and the whiny tone of your editor, you rewrite your article yet again and hopefully get it approved for printing.

The agile way of working, however, introduces the idea of *continuous press*. In this process, every little iteration each team member makes adds value to the whole, continuously building upon it from different perspectives and sources until it is a well-rounded, creative work. Each addition could then be reviewed by someone else in an editing step, ensuring nothing gets too crazy. Ideally, the creative work should be built upon in such a way that it is publishable after every addition. This way, every article is in a constantly "finished" state.

Enabling an agile workflow best situates people to use their talents within a team while also benefitting from the complimentary talents and insights of others. This, while working together to deliver publishable, creative works quickly and efficiently, makes for some very strong macaroni bridges.
