At New Atoms, we don't work as individuals with specific tasks, but rather as a team in which every team member contributes small iterations to the whole. This enables us to work from our strengths instead of from necessity.

This is called *agile* working and is mainly used in software engineering. Simply stated, *agile* teams work on projects that aim to achieve a specific goal. This goal is broken up into smaller tasks that can be fulfilled by individual team members. This way, every team member can choose tasks that suit their own strengths and experiences and execute them in the way they think best serves the larger goal. By enabling team members to work on a project in the way they see fit, solutions emerge that no one individual could ever expect, enabling teams to go beyond conventions into newer and more fruitful territories.

In a way, you could say that New Atoms functions just like a pit crew. We all work from our own strengths and experiences toward the same goal, on the same project at the same time. That is why we can make really cool stuff, really well, really quickly.
