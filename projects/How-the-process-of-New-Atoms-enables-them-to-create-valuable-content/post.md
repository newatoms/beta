We are trying, as a team, to revolutionize the news industry. 

We imagine news that has broken free from centuries-old methods. We imagine articles that have escaped the problematic tradition of a single voice, perspective and ego. We imagine *real* collaboration.

## Traditional journalism is a one-man band

Traditionally, producing an article goes something like this: You are a journalist. You find a subject, you do some research, you start writing. You discover your research is inadequate, so you do some more. You interview someone. Maybe you run it by a colleague, who has an idea that you implement. Re-write. In time, you present your work to your editor. She has some comments and offers perspectives you failed to think of. Annoyed by your own lack of insight, you re-write. Eventually, your work gets approved for printing.

Several people have contributed to the writing process. So, collaboration, right? Nope.

We actually believe this process is borderline lunacy in today's world. In the spirit of information sharing, we think the field of journalism can be vastly improved with works created by a whole diverse, multidisciplinary team. Each contributor's research, skills, views and voice blend together to make something more dimensional and balanced than what we are accustomed to reading.
## Agile journalism empowers real collaboration

In order to counter the outdated traditions of journalism, we try to build upon multiple creative works simultaneously, in small iterations, together.

This process isn't new. It's been used in software engineering for the last decade or so. This super-smart group of people calls it *agile working*.

Normally, agile teams first identify the goal of a project, then work on the project with the sole aim of achieving that goal. To make this possible, the goal is broken up into smaller tasks that can be fulfilled by individual team members. This way, the project keeps its momentum and every team member can choose tasks that suit her or his own strengths, quickly building upon one another's work. All these smaller tasks then coalesce to form the whole. Even better, everyone can execute the tasks in the way they think best serves the larger goal.

In our version of this process, every little iteration a team member contributes adds value to the whole. The article is continuously built upon from our different perspectives and research until it is a well-rounded, creative work.

## Increasing creative freedom by working together

By enabling our team members to work in this way, solutions emerge that no one individual could ever expect. Things develop from multiple perspectives. This is hyper-collaboration that harnesses individual talent. It enables us to go beyond the conventions and constraints of traditional journalism into newer and more fruitful territories.

Enabling an agile workflow best situates us to use our talents within our team. We (and our work) are benefitting from the complimentary talents and insights of others, working in true collaboration to deliver creative works.
