# How applying for funding helped us get to know and develop our concept

## Update: What a ride… 
When we heard about the Digital News Initiative from Google, we simply had to reply. It’s right up our alley, perfectly aligned with our ambitions and, come on, they’re funding €150 million!

After four weeks of focussed, hard work on a single document (with four writers and three editors), it was time to evaluate. Finally, on December 3rd, 2015—with one hell of a trembling index finger—we pushed the send button.

Our application form was sent; there was no turning back. I strongly advise every startup or starting entrepreneur to apply for some kind of funding. We’ve certainly learned a lot from writing the application.


## Our golden idea: *editorial.supply*
Like every startup, we are looking for funding to test our assumptions, create products and build a business. Through technology and collaboration, we’re trying to innovate the way journalism and editorial content are made.

This is why we want to create *editorial.supply*, and here is how we introduced the Google Digital News Initiative to the project:

*Access a great editorial team without the hassle, for those who need high-quality custom editorial content and fine-grained control over the process.*

*Our app enables users to easily become an editor with full control. They can configure their editorial concept in the settings, approve pitches from the editorial team, and edit and approve produced articles.*

*All articles are made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of writers, researchers, engagement specialists, coders, designers and others in a close-knit collaboration, responding to editorial concepts with pitches for stories, then creating the articles based on chosen pitches.*

*The team side of our software integrates communication, automation, and collaboration tools such as a semantic graph notebook to share sources, concepts and ideas.*

I think we changed this text fifteen times, if not more. In total we had to answer nine big questions, some responses being small, others huge. We reached every character limit telling as much as we could.  

## How Google’s DNI application helped us write our business plan
We were forced to articulate everything from a detailed project overview, specific outcome and broader impact to questions about innovation in technology and editorial components. We researched and gave examples of competitors’ approaches who tackle comparable problems to budgeting, planning and evaluation. Then, last but not least, our darlings (and no, we would not kill them): Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) and Metrics. You guessed it—not so much a walk in the park as draining blood from stones.

We realised this was all for a good cause, and thinking about this stuff made us realise how important each question is for running our business. How do we measure team effectiveness? What metrics do we give to effort? How do we define "hassle"? These are some questions that had to be asked and answered in order to define our business goals.

We experienced that an effective answer is fuel for your creative engine and can sweep you into a flow, like a stream into a river. We’ll either get the funding or we won't. If the latter, this will all have been a good exercise in fully understanding and subsequently pitching our concept. We had to look at it like the business plan of the product, as well as the opportunity to sit down and commit ourselves to write.

We pitched our concept, sculpted, scuffed, added and removed. We felt like we owned our idea. With it’s tiny hairs and freckles as birthmarks, we knew it like the back of our hands. Luckily, we were blessed with a couple of great advisors and editors who placed us with both feet on the ground. They convinced us there was more to do—a lot of extra work, but it just got better and better.

Finally, we asked ourselves: *did we tell them everything we wanted to tell them? Will they be as enthusiastic about this plan as we are? Will they see the potential, innovation and scalability of this product?*

At the very end of our editing marathon, one of us won gold with one hell of a comment. The winner ↘︎

Eventually, after sending it on December 3rd, 12:18 CET, we like to think we did.

## Update: They liked it!
Google has responded. They want to support the project for the full amount we’ve requested.

Naturally, we’ll keep you updated on what happens with editorial.supply.
