*"I'm interested in large, complex systems. I wanna know why people do things, what makes them do things, and how all these things fit together."*

# The Experience that Cried for a New Business

One of Boris's most uttered words, to the annoyance of most of the people who surround him, is "*why*".
"*Why* is there a need for this to exist?", "*Why* would you want to change this and *why* haven't you?", "*Why* are we not asking *why*?" Even though it can be wildly annoying at times, it enables him to understand small bits of the world around him. The more small bits of understanding he collects, the more they contribute to a bigger understandingâ€”an understanding that leads to a hunger for even more understanding.

This hunger has steered him into software development, media production, design, consulting in the cultural space, managing various teams, and eventually into the field of journalism, a world that exists solely to investigate the *what*s and the *why*s about the things that move our world. Even within a context in which curiosity is fundamental, Boris noticed that there were few questions regarding methods and motives and that the way journalism is practiced is stuck in mostly irrelevant traditions.

Boris says about his experiences that "whenever you cross those boundaries into another field, you see the things in which that field is better than other fields, or things that field is behind in from other fields."

This led to an urge to understand and improve the field of journalism, and so he went to work. During this time, he [injected his commitment to understand](http://www.slideshare.net/SNDupdate/boris-van-hoytema-at-snddc-making-the-future-of-news-46870634?ref=http://www.snd.org/dc2015/finding-neverland-boris-van-hoytema-on-the-upside-of-utopia-plus-5-mantras-for-design/) into the BBC's [*Future of News*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-bbb9e158-4a1b-43c7-8b3b-9651938d4d6a) project, an initiative that tries to understand future global news trends and innovate accordingly.

While poking around in the business of the BBC, Boris stumbled on a set of structural problems that make it hard for news organisations to keep up with the market. The two key fields for improvement: scalability and adaptability.

First of all, the way in which media companies currently grow quickly leads to scalability problems. Let's say a newspaper hires someone to write a story on corruption in Afghanistan. This person is charged with understanding everything about the situation there. Not only will she write the story herself, but she will need to make a trip there and do all the research involved herself, so she will spend 100% of her time on this one article.

Now let's say the same newspaper hires two more people: one to write a blogpost about beers in Belgium and another one to write about fries in France. It may seem like the newspaper has increased its production by 300%. However, all of these people now need to make trips, do research and may need mediation at some point in their process. This causes a drastic increase in overhead, making your production per person diminish and leaving you with less value for your money. This is obviously a very bad incentive for media companies to grow.

So, says Boris, these companies need to look at the way in which technological organisations grow: they hire people to make the company as a whole more valuable. Implementing this system-of sharing knowledge, work and experience-in media production, enables individuals to increase their production as well as that of the people around them.

And so the idea for New Atoms was born.
