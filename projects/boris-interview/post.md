# The Experience that Cried for a New Business

One of Boris's most uttered words, to the annoyance of most of the people who surround him, is "*why*".
"*Why* is there a need for this to exist?", "*Why* would you want to change this and *why* haven't you?", "*Why* are we not asking *why*?" Even though it can be wildly annoying at times, it enables him to understand small bits of the world around him. The more small bits of understanding he collects, the more they contribute to a bigger understanding—an understanding that leads to a hunger for even more understanding.

This hunger steered him into the field journalism, a world filled with people who specialise in asking the *what*s and the *why*s about the things that move our world. Even within a group of naturally curious people, Boris noticed that few would question themselves about their methods and motives.

This led to an urge to understand and improve the field of journalism, and so he went to work. During this time, he worked as a Journalist, an Editorial Consultant, a Designer, a Programmer, and a Producer for [BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news). He  [injected his commitment to understand](http://www.slideshare.net/SNDupdate/boris-van-hoytema-at-snddc-making-the-future-of-news-46870634?ref=http://www.snd.org/dc2015/finding-neverland-boris-van-hoytema-on-the-upside-of-utopia-plus-5-mantras-for-design/) into the BBC's [*Future of News*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-bbb9e158-4a1b-43c7-8b3b-9651938d4d6a) project, an initiative that tries to understand future global news trends and innovate accordingly.

While poking around in the business of the BBC, Boris stumbled on a set of structural problems that make it hard for news organisations to keep up with the market. The two key fields for improvement: scalability and adaptability.

First of all the way in which media companies currently grow will quickly lead to scalability problems. Because when a company hires one person to write a story on corruption in Afghanistan...

Enter New Atoms.

To understand what "scalability" problems in journalism are — As a reader — I can read how boris explains it in the interview with krysten

Media has creative minds on the team and they do something. This person is charged with understanding everything. If you're a journalist writing a piece about corruption in Afghanistan, then you do all the things, research and write the article. So we hire one journalist for Afghanistan story, and one about beers in Belgium and one for fries in France and they all spend 100% of his time to that project. So you have 300% production, in comparison with the first person, right? But you also gain overhead, so with every person you add, your production per person diminishes. So, the more people you add, the more overhead you'll have, so the less value you get for your money. This is not a very good incentive for media companies to grow. Technology organisations try to hire people to make the whole more valuable. It increaser their own production, but also that of people around them. That's growth. What we try to do, is implementing this system in media production. Share knowledge, work, experience and really not look at it as one person makes something, but a group or the whole organisation makes something and every person in the organisation is tasked with making everyone else be as valuable as possible.
