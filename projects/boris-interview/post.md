# The Experience that Cried for a New Business

One of Boris's most uttered words, to the anoyance of most of the people who surround him, is "*why*".
"*Why* is there a need for this to exist?", "*Why* would you want to change this and *why* havent you?", "*Why* are we not asking *why*?" Even though it can be wildly annoying at times, it has also enabled him to understand small bits of the world with which he would come into contact. The more small bits of understanding he collected, the more they contributed to a bigger understandingâ€”an understanding that led to a hunger for more.

This steered him into the field journalism, a world filled wih professionals in asking the *what*s and the *why*s about the things that move our world. Even within a group of naturally curious people, Boris noticed that few would question themselves about their methods and motives.

This led to an urge to understand and improve the field of journalism, and so he went to work. During this time, he worked as a Journalist, an Editorial Consultant, a Designer, a Programmer, and a Producer for [BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news). He  [injected his commitment to understand](http://www.slideshare.net/SNDupdate/boris-van-hoytema-at-snddc-making-the-future-of-news-46870634?ref=http://www.snd.org/dc2015/finding-neverland-boris-van-hoytema-on-the-upside-of-utopia-plus-5-mantras-for-design/) into the BBC's [*Future of News*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-bbb9e158-4a1b-43c7-8b3b-9651938d4d6a) project, an initiative that tries to understand future global news trends and innovate accordingly.

While poking around in the business of the BBC, Boris stumbled on a set of structural problems that make it hard for news organisations to keep up with the market and came up with a few solutions for the shorter and the longer term. The two key fields for improvement: scalability and adaptability.

Enter New Atoms.
