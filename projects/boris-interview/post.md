# The Experience that Cried for a New Business

One of Boris's most uttered words, to the annoyance of most of the people who surround him, is "*why*".
"*Why* is there a need for this to exist?", "*Why* would you want to change this and *why* haven't you?", "*Why* are we not asking *why*?" Even though it can be wildly annoying at times, it enables him to understand small bits of the world around him. The more small bits of understanding he collects, the more they contribute to a bigger understandingâ€”an understanding that leads to a hunger for even more understanding.

This hunger steered him into the field journalism, a world filled with people who specialise in asking the *what*s and the *why*s about the things that move our world. Even within a group of naturally curious people, Boris noticed that few would question themselves about their methods and motives.

This led to an urge to understand and improve the field of journalism, and so he went to work. During this time, he worked as a Journalist, an Editorial Consultant, a Designer, a Programmer, and a Producer for [BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news). He  [injected his commitment to understand](http://www.slideshare.net/SNDupdate/boris-van-hoytema-at-snddc-making-the-future-of-news-46870634?ref=http://www.snd.org/dc2015/finding-neverland-boris-van-hoytema-on-the-upside-of-utopia-plus-5-mantras-for-design/) into the BBC's [*Future of News*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-bbb9e158-4a1b-43c7-8b3b-9651938d4d6a) project, an initiative that tries to understand future global news trends and innovate accordingly.

While poking around in the business of the BBC, Boris stumbled on a set of structural problems that make it hard for news organisations to keep up with the market. The two key fields for improvement: scalability and adaptability.

First of all, the way in which media companies currently grow quickly leads to scalability problems. Let's say a newspaper hires someone to write a story on corruption in Afghanistan. Not only will this person write the story, but they will need to make a trip there and do all the research involved, so they will spend 100% of their time on this one article.

Now let's say the same newspaper hires two more people: one to write a blogpost about beers in Belgium and another one to write about fries in France. It may seem like the newspaper has increased its production by 300%. However, all of these people now need to make trips, do research and may need mediation at some point in their process. This causes a drastic increase in overhead, making your production per person diminish and leaving you with less value for your money. This is obviously a very bad incentive for media companies to grow.

So, says Boris, these companies need to look at the way in which technological organisations grow: they hire people to make the company as a whole more valuable. Implementing this system-of sharing knowledge, work and experience-in media production, enables individuals to increase their production as well as that of the people around them.

And so the idea for New Atoms was born.
