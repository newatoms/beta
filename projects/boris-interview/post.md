*"I'm interested in large, complex systems. I wanna know why people do things, what makes them do things, and how all these things fit together."*

# The Experience that Cried for a New Business


Meet Boris. Boris is our boss. One of his most uttered words, to the annoyance of most of the people who surround him, is "why". "*Why* is there a need for this to exist?" "*Why* would you want to change this and *why* haven't you?" "*Why* are we not asking *why*?" Even though it can be wildly annoying at times, it enables him to understand small bits of the world around him. The more small bits of understanding he collects, the more they contribute to a bigger understanding. An understanding that leads to a hunger for even more understanding.

## How crossing boundaries offers perspective
This hunger has steered him into software development, media production and design. He also consulted in the cultural space, managed various teams, and eventually found himself in the field of journalism. He felt at home in this field that exists solely to investigate the *what*s and the *why*s about the things that move our world.  Boris:

> "I'm interested in large, complex systems. I wanna know why people do things, what makes them do things, and how all these things fit together."

Even within a context in which curiosity is fundamental, Boris noticed that there were few questions regarding methods and motives. This causes the way journalism is practiced to be stuck in mostly irrelevant traditions.

Boris says about his experiences that "whenever you cross the boundaries into another field, you see the things in which that field is better than others, or ways in which that field is behind others."

This led to an urge to understand and improve the field of journalism, and so he went to work. During this time, he [applied his commitment to understand](http://www.slideshare.net/SNDupdate/boris-van-hoytema-at-snddc-making-the-future-of-news-46870634?ref=http://www.snd.org/dc2015/finding-neverland-boris-van-hoytema-on-the-upside-of-utopia-plus-5-mantras-for-design/) to the BBC's [*Future of News*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-bbb9e158-4a1b-43c7-8b3b-9651938d4d6a) project. This is an initiative that tries to understand future global news trends and innovate accordingly.

## The problems with journalism today
This led to a lot of poking around in the business of the BBC. Boris stumbled on a set of structural problems that make it hard for news organisations to keep up with the market. The two key fields for improvement: *scalability* and *adaptability*.

First of all, the way in which media companies currently grow quickly leads to scalability problems. Let's say a newspaper hires someone to write a story on The National Front in France. This person is charged with understanding everything about the situation there. Not only will she write the story herself, but she will need to travel there and do all the research involved herself. This means she will spend 100% of her time on this one article.

Once all the research has been done, conclusions have been drawn, and everything is pulled together into a well rounded article, it gets published. Only then does it become visible for the rest of the world, including all other journalists. The problem with this, is that no journalist ever puts all their research into the final work.

Now let's say the newspaper is totally getting into a groove for France and hires two more people—one to write a blogpost about their lovely wines and another to write about the latest French fashion.

It may seem like the newspaper has increased its production by 300%. However, because each journalist only has access to the research that has been published, they are all required to take their own trips and do their own research.

There is no system in journalism that allows journalists to share more than what exists in published articles, limiting journalists mostly to their own research.

This causes a drastic increase in overhead, causing the production per person to diminish and leaving the organisation with less value for its money. This is obviously a very bad incentive for media companies to grow.

## What journalism can learn from technological organisations
So, says Boris, these companies need to look at the way in which technological organisations––think silicon valley––grow. They hire people with a variety of experience and skills to make the company as a whole more valuable. Each person contributes from their strengths. Implementing such a system in media production––one of sharing knowledge, work, and experience––enables individuals to increase their production as well as that of the people around them.

The other fundamental problem in the news industry, is how adapts to changes in the world. This becomes very apparent when you compare the news industry to the technology sector in how they have adapted the rise in internet usage. The technology sector is simply so much better at adapting to the changing behaviours of its audience. Therefore, it is able to fulfill a lot of their needs much more immediately than the news industry.

Boris apprehends that
> the moment traditional media and news media dropped one beat;
the moment they didn't adapt quickly enough to what their user base needed from them;
the moment they failed to provide good, quick, reliable news sources on the internet, other media stepped in and it was over.

## The consequences of an inflexible trade
What are the implications? Now, people in news media have been usurped by people in technology. The former are very conscious of which messages are being sent, how they are formulated, and the ways in which they impact the world. The latter have a lot less awareness about what the role and influence of such messages is. They don't understand that, when they transmit widely significant information, they change people's lives.

What they do understand is that they're effectively making a product that people are buying. Naturally, they continue to develop the product, their decisions directed by user research. In doing this, they're actually (often unconsciously) changing many things such as politics, government and the ways in which people interact with one another.

## The solution? A marriage
The idea that you could really change the world if you have access to a lot of people is highly relevant to journalism. Social media is very interesting for that reason. We all have a responsibility in shaping the future and mass media is a tool for such an endeavour. If you have well-functioning, mindful mass media, then the future can be shaped in the right ways.

Technology developed a system which uses every communication method available, the modern ways of working, and the ability to share information on a massive scale. With that, they solve a lot of the same problems with which journalism is struggling using a different kind of process.

And so the idea for New Atoms was born.
