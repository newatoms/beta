# The Experience that Cried for a New Business

One of Boris's most uttered words, to the annoyance of most of the people who surround him, is "*why*".
"*Why* is there a need for this to exist?", "*Why* would you want to change this and *why* haven't you?", "*Why* are we not asking *why*?" Even though it can be wildly annoying at times, it enables him to understand small bits of the world around him. The more small bits of understanding he collects, the more they contribute to a bigger understanding—an understanding that leads to a hunger for even more understanding.

This hunger steered him into the field of journalism, a world that exists solely to investigate the *what*s and the *why*s about the things that move our world. Even within a context in which curiosity is fundamental, Boris noticed that there were few questions regarding methods and motives and that the way journalism is practiced is stuck in now-irrelevant traditions.

This led to an urge to understand and improve the field of journalism, and so he went to work. During this time, he worked as a Journalist, an Editorial Consultant, a Designer, a Programmer, and a Producer for [BBC News](http://www.bbc.com/news). He applied [his commitment to understand](http://www.slideshare.net/SNDupdate/boris-van-hoytema-at-snddc-making-the-future-of-news-46870634?ref=http://www.snd.org/dc2015/finding-neverland-boris-van-hoytema-on-the-upside-of-utopia-plus-5-mantras-for-design/) to the BBC's [*Future of News*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-bbb9e158-4a1b-43c7-8b3b-9651938d4d6a) project, an initiative that analyses future global news trends and innovate accordingly.

While poking around in the business of the BBC, Boris stumbled on a set of structural problems that make it hard for news organisations to keep up with the market. The two key fields for improvement: **scalability** and **adaptability**.

First of all, the way in which media companies currently grow quickly leads to scalability problems. Lets say a newspaper hires someone to write a story on corruption in Afghanistan. Not only will this person write the story, they will potentially need to travel there and do all the research involved. They will spend 100% of their working time on this one article.

Now let's say the same newspaper hires two more people: one to write a blogpost about beers in Belgium and another one to write about fries in France. It may seem like the newspaper has increased its production by 300%. However, all of these people now need to make trips, do research and may need mediation at some point in their process. This causes a drastic increase in overhead, causing the production per person diminish and leaving the organisation with less value for its money. This is obviously a very bad incentive for media companies to grow.

So, says Boris, these companies need to look at the way in which technological organisations grow: they hire people with a variety of experience and skills to make the company as a whole more valuable. Each person contributes from their strengths. Implementing such a system in media production (one of sharing knowledge, work, and experience) enables individuals to increase their production as well as that of the people around them.

The other fundamental problem in the news industry is the difficulty it has adapting to developments in technology, specifically those that influence social behaviour. Because the technology sector is so much better at adapting to the changing behaviours of its audience and its user base, it is able to fulfill a lot of their needs much more immediately than the news industry.

Boris apprehends that
> the moment traditional media and news media drop one beat—the moment they don't manage to adapt quickly enough to what their user base needs from them... the moment [they fail to] provide good, quick news sources on the internet, with enough reliability as they did with television...—other media stepped in and it was over.

What are the implications? Now, people who are very conscious of which messages are being sent, how they are formulated, and the ways in which they impact the world (those in news media) have been usurped by people who have a lot less awareness about what the role and influence of such messages is (those in technology). They don't understand that, when they transmit widely significant information, they change people's lives.

What they do understand is that they're effectively making a product that people are buying. Naturally, they continue to develop the product, their decisions directed by user research. In doing this, they're actually (often unconsciously) changing politics, changing government, changing the ways in which people interact with one another.

The idea that you could really change the world if you have access to a lot of people is highly relevant to journalism. Social media is highly interesting for that reason: it's all of our role to shape the future and mass media is a tool for such an endeavour. If you have well- functioning, mindful mass media, then the future can be shaped in the right ways.

Technology developed a system which uses every communication method available, the modern ways of working, and the ability to share information on a massive scale. With that, they solve a lot of the same problems with which journalism is struggling using a different kind of process.

And so the idea for New Atoms was born.
