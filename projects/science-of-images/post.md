When used correctly, effective visuals can communicate a message very powerfully. There are a number of interesting scientific and psychological explanations for why certain images resonate with people and others don't:

## Appeal

Appeal refers to natural attraction towards visual content and how it manages to attract even those with short attention spans. We might not be able to explain why we love an image because [our conscious thought hasn’t yet caught up with our subconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_relationship). Deeply emotional reactions are some of the strongest connections we can make to visual content. They occur from the part of the brain that is also related to our [survival instincts](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/wired-for-survival1.htm), which means that the reaction may be more direct and intense.

Visual content should indicate the emotion for which it aims. This could be accomplished abstractly with color, metaphors, or irony, for example. Or it could be achieved concretely with associations which elicit the "right" feeling (safety, food, positivity, love...).

## Comprehension

Comprehension is linked to the way our brains translate data in order to simplify it. It has been observed that 90% of the information sent to our brains is visual, with our brains responding to it 60,000 faster than they do for text.

Thus, our brains need a visual representation to process information faster and create a connection between the visual object and its concept. It’s impressive how the visual perception in our brain makes such a complex task easy. This could also be a scientific explanation for why "an image is worth a thousand words.”

## Retention

Retention is related to the memorable experience that visual content tends to create. There are now [algorithms created by MIT researchers](http://news.mit.edu/2015/csail-deep-learning-algorithm-predicts-photo-memorability-near-human-levels-1215) that predict photos' memorability at near-human levels. According to the algorithm, [weird and counterintuitive images do well, as do conflict and suspense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/12/29/forget-beautiful-sunrises-embrace-absurdity-heres-how-to-take-memorable-photos/).
