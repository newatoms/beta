According to the images they use on their posts, it seems like a lot of bloggers like cappuccinos with foam art. They work on the same laptops, but still use paper and pencils to show they are creative. All fine, but why does everyone use these generic stock photos when they don’t say anything about the written content?

When used correctly, effective visuals can communicate a message very powerfully. There are a number of interesting scientific and psychological explanations for why certain images resonate with people and others don't:

## Appeal

Appeal refers to natural attraction towards visual content and how it manages to attract even those with short attention spans. We might not be able to explain why we love an image because [our conscious thought hasn’t yet caught up with our subconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_relationship). Deeply emotional reactions are some of the strongest connections we can make to visual content. They occur from the part of the brain that is also related to our [survival instincts](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/wired-for-survival1.htm), which means that the reaction may be more direct and intense.

Visual content should indicate the emotion for which it aims. This could be accomplished abstractly with colour, metaphors, or irony, for example. Or it could be achieved concretely with associations which elicit the "right" feeling (safety, food, positivity, love...).

## Comprehension

Comprehension is linked to the way our brains translate data in order to simplify it. It has been observed that 90% of the information sent to our brains is visual, with our brains responding to it 60,000 faster than they do for text.

Thus, our brains need a visual representation to process information faster and create a connection between the visual object and its concept. It’s impressive how the visual perception in our brain makes such a complex task easy. This could also be a scientific explanation for why "an image is worth a thousand words.”

## Retention

Retention is related to the memorable experience that visual content tends to create. There are now [algorithms created by MIT researchers](http://news.mit.edu/2015/csail-deep-learning-algorithm-predicts-photo-memorability-near-human-levels-1215) that predict photos' memorability at near-human levels. According to the algorithm, [weird and counterintuitive images do well, as do conflict and suspense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/12/29/forget-beautiful-sunrises-embrace-absurdity-heres-how-to-take-memorable-photos/).

## Now what?

How can you apply this user behaviour knowledge so that people will resonate with your images? In a practical sense, according to [Haje Jan Kamps](https://medium.com/@Haje/your-press-release-needs-images-22a70ac3e1b1#.dlo0ykfq4), "the best [images] are something people can relate to in one way or another, which usually means that the images need to tell part of the story."

To make it easier on yourself, you can set some guidelines: 

* Images should be interesting on their own. 
* Trigger curiosity; don’t go for the obvious. 
* Images should create a context. Create an atmosphere into which you would like your readers to enter.
* Images need to tell part of the story.

Especially if you’re collaborating on content, it’s important to be able to rationalise your images. Saying: “the image is beautiful and nice” just won’t cut it. You certainly had a goal or a reason before you started writing an article. Why wouldn’t you do the same with your visual content? Maybe just ask yourself: *Are pictures of cappuccinos and laptops on desks worth a thousand words?*
