You may be creating a context for your writing into which no one really wants to enter. We all certainly have a goal or a reason before starting to write an article. Why wouldn’t we do the same with our visual content?

According to the images seen atop their posts, a lot of bloggers are evidently writing about cappuccinos with foam art or strategically arranged laptops, smartphones, paper and pencils. We suppose that's all fine if that's the case, but why would one use these generic stock photos when they don’t say anything about the written content?

To give ourselves an alternative for generic photos (and to prevent losing the fight for our readers' attention), we ask ourselves: How can we apply science and user behaviour knowledge to image finding so that readers will resonate with our images? According to [Haje Jan Kamps](https://medium.com/@Haje/your-press-release-needs-images-22a70ac3e1b1#.dlo0ykfq4), "the best [images] are something people can relate to in one way or another, which usually means that *the images need to tell part of the story*."

When used effectively, visual imagery can communicate a powerful message. There are scientific and psychological explanations for why certain images are relatable (or aren't) and tell your story successfully (or don't):

## Appeal

This is a natural attraction towards visual content and how it manages to attract even those with the shortest attention spans. We might not be able to explain *why* we love an image because [our conscious thought hasn’t yet caught up with our subconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_relationship).

Immediate, emotional reactions are some of the strongest connections we can make to visual content. They occur from the part of the brain that is also related to our [survival instincts](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/wired-for-survival1.htm), which means that the reaction will likely be more direct and intense.

Visual content should indicate the emotion for which it aims. This could be accomplished abstractly with colour, metaphors, or irony, for example. Or it could be achieved concretely with associations which elicit the "right" feeling (safety, food, positivity, love...).

## Comprehension

Comprehension is linked to the way our brains translate data in order to simplify it. It has been [observed](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33423/19-Reasons-You-Should-Include-Visual-Content-in-Your-Marketing-Data.aspx#sm.00001ztsyhxnje9dr7r1i72p6g37j) that 90% of the information sent to our brains is visual, with our brains responding to it 60,000 faster than they do for text.

Thus, our brains need a picture to process information faster and create a connection between the visual representation and its concept. It’s impressive how the visual perception in our brain makes such a complex task easy. This could also be a scientific explanation for why "an image is worth a thousand words.”

## Retention

Retention is related to the memorable experience that visual content tends to create. There are now [algorithms created by MIT researchers](http://news.mit.edu/2015/csail-deep-learning-algorithm-predicts-photo-memorability-near-human-levels-1215) that predict photos' memorability at near-human levels. According to the algorithm, [weird and counterintuitive images do well, as do conflict and suspense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/12/29/forget-beautiful-sunrises-embrace-absurdity-heres-how-to-take-memorable-photos/).

## We scienced the $#!† out of images, so now what?

Keeping all of this science and psychology in mind while looking for an image feels overwhelming. To make it easier on ourselves, we set some relevant guidelines:

* Images should be interesting on their own.
* Images should trigger curiosity. Don’t go for the obvious.
* Images should create a context. Establish an atmosphere into which you would like your readers to enter.
* Images need to tell part of the story.

One last suggestion to make all of this less daunting: don’t start by trying to find the perfect image, only to end up spending hours searching. Iterating on content until it's good enough to publish is effective not only with [the writing process](insert Macaroni Bridges link here, if it's published!), but with finding effective images as well:

This is an example of our process, which had a duration of about 30 minutes in total. Justifying each subsequent image in accordance with the article and the research above positioned Krysten to look for a better image. She eventually got frustrated and gave up, settling on a "super cheesy potential image".

Because the process was documented and each image was rationalised, the next person to attempt the task could pick up where she left off rather than starting from the beginning.

Especially if you’re collaborating on content, it’s important to be able to rationalise your images. With all the brain power we can muster (and that of people much smarter than us), we are trying to create contexts for our writing that people actually want to enter. Saying: “the image is beautiful and nice” just won’t cut it. Maybe just ask yourself: Are pictures of cappuccinos and laptops on desks worth a thousand words?
