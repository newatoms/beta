*The deadly sin of latte art imagery. By [Michael Allen Smith](https://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/)*

**It pays off to enrich your content with great imagery. But what makes an image good? We consulted scientific research to find out.**

We all certainly have a goal or a reason before starting to write an article. Why wouldn’t we do the same with our visual content? It pays off greatly to find a valuable image that sticks. It makes your articles more appealing, comprehensible, and memorable.

Stating that effective images can communicate messages powerfully isn't exactly cutting-edge. So then why is it that so many bloggers love to use pictures of pretty latte art or workspaces strategically organised with Apple laptops and craft paper? Not only are they boring, they don’t say anything about the written content. As it turns out, finding a good image is hard.

According to [@Haje Jan Kamps](https://medium.com/@Haje/your-press-release-needs-images-22a70ac3e1b1#.dlo0ykfq4), "the best images are something people can relate to in one way or another, which usually means that *the images need to tell part of the story*."

That's a good start, but it doesn't offer much practical information. Luckily, we can always rely on science.

## The *appeal* factor: Back to our survival instincts

We all have it once in a while: we're struck by a stunning image that induces little inner sparks of enjoyment or horror. Your eyes get wider, you move your head a little closer to the screen and you contemplate while suppressing the urge of sharing your findings just yet.

These encounters with our emotions are hard to explain. *Why* an image is beautiful is often described as being subjective, but scientists wouldn't be scientist if they don't try to objectify the subjective.

*Appeal* is our natural attraction towards an image. We might not be able to explain *why* we love an image because [our conscious thought hasn’t yet caught up with our subconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_relationship).

Immediate, emotional reactions are some of the strongest connections we can make to visual content. They occur from the part of the brain that is also related to our [survival instincts](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/wired-for-survival1.htm), which means that the reaction will likely be more direct and intense if it appeals to our emotions.

Visual content should indicate the emotion for which it aims. This could be accomplished abstractly with colour, metaphors, or irony, for example. Or it could be achieved concretely with associations which elicit the "right" feeling (safety, food, positivity, love...).

## The *comprehension* element: Faster than our own shadows

For your high-speed brain, instantaneously triggering emotions is a common activity. So how quickly are we able to grasp the concept of an image? Images are understandable much more quickly than words.

This is because *comprehension* is linked to the way our brains translate data in order to simplify it. [It has been observed that 90% of the information sent to our brains is visual](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33423/19-Reasons-You-Should-Include-Visual-Content-in-Your-Marketing-Data.aspx#sm.00001ztsyhxnje9dr7r1i72p6g37j), with our brains responding to it 60,000 faster than they do for text.

Thus, our brains need a picture to process information faster and create a connection between the visual representation and its concept. It’s impressive how the visual perception in our brain makes such a complex task easy. This could also be a scientific explanation for why "an image is worth a thousand words.”

## The *retention* capacity: Go weird and crazy

*Retention* is related to the memorable experience that visual content tends to create. There are [algorithms created by MIT researchers](http://news.mit.edu/2015/csail-deep-learning-algorithm-predicts-photo-memorability-near-human-levels-1215) that predict photos' memorability at near-human levels. According to the algorithm, [weird and counterintuitive images do well, as do conflict and suspense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/12/29/forget-beautiful-sunrises-embrace-absurdity-heres-how-to-take-memorable-photos/).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/wJ8JJyZ.jpg" alt="Mule wearing gas masks in WWI, 1916" width="41.7%" />

*The landscape picture, though beautiful, gets a low score of 0.421, while the striking gas mask picture gets a high score of 0.703.*

On the MIT researches' website [you can upload your own picture to measure the memorability score](http://memorability.csail.mit.edu/demo.html).  

If you get a high score on memorability (retention) it means the image has got our attention. The retention score has a lot to do with our experience of seeing pictures and the familiarity we have with them. Researchers at The Pennsylvania State University measured the *Familiarity* we have with pictures in:

[Studying Aesthetics in Photographic Images Using a Computational Approach](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~wangz/project/imsearch/Aesthetics/ECCV06/datta.pdf).

Because of our curiosity, when we see something unusual or rare we perceive it in a different way from what we get to see on a regular basis. Therefore it increases the chance of retention.   

## The *technical* part: improve your judgement on beauty

Until now we found out: why it's hard to say *why* we find an image beautiful. Because the *why* relates to our emotions. We also found out why we should pay more attention to choosing an image for our content. Because we humans have a very talented high-speed brain for recognising concepts of something visual. And that pictures get attention if they're out of the ordinary, weird and original.   

Now we're getting to the technical part of photography and how to use this knowledge to your advantage when looking for an image. The researchers at The Pennsylvania State University described certain technology tactics.

Among others, these tactics were described as *appealing* to people when executed well:

**Exposure of Light and Colourfulness**
> Too much exposure (leading to brighter shots) often yields lower quality pictures. Those that are too dark are often also not appealing. Thus light exposure can often be a good discriminant between high and low quality photographs.

*The proposed colorfulness measure. The two photographs on the left have high values while the two on the right have low values.*

**Saturation**
> Saturation indicates chromatic purity. Pure colors in a photo tend to be more appealing than dull or impure ones. Professionals enhance the saturation to result in deeper blue sky, greener grass, more vivid flowers, etc.

**The Rule of Thirds**
> A very popular rule of thumb in photography is the Rule of Thirds. We observed that most professional photographs that follow this rule have the main object stretch from an intersection up to the center of the image.

**Low Depth of Field Indicators**
> Professional photographers often reduce the depth of field (DOF) for shooting single objects.

More knowledge about the technology behind photography will improve your judgement of what is beautiful and what isn't.

## We scienced the $#!† out of images, so now what?

Keeping all of this science and psychology in mind while looking for an image feels overwhelming. To make it easier on ourselves, we set some relevant guidelines:

* **Images should trigger curiosity.** Don’t go for the obvious.
* **Images should create a context.** Establish an atmosphere into which you would like your readers to enter.
* **Images need to tell part of the story.** They should be relatable.
* **A header image should work on its own, even outside its context.** The header image is often the first and only thing people see. You want to grab their attention with *appeal* and *retention* quality.   

Especially if you’re collaborating on content, it’s important to be able to rationalise your images. With all the brain power we can muster (and that of people much smarter than us), we are trying to create contexts for our writing that people actually want to enter. Saying: “the image is beautiful and nice” just won’t cut it. Maybe just ask yourself: Are pictures of cappuccinos and laptops on desks worth a thousand words?
