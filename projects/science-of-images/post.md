*The deadly sin of latte art imagery. By [Michael Allen Smith](https://www.flickr.com/photos/digitalcolony/)*

Combining your content with valuable images that stick pays off greatly, as effective images can communicate messages powerfully. They trigger curiosity, create context and tell part of your story. Getting it right can make your article more appealing, comprehensible, and memorable.

Yes, images are so important. This isn't exactly cutting-edge knowledge. Then why is it that so many bloggers love to use pictures of pretty latte art or workspaces strategically organised with Apple laptops and craft paper? Not only are they boring, they don’t say anything about the written content. Well, finding a good image isn't easy. In this article we will focus on how to find that million dollar image. According to [Haje Jan Kamps](https://medium.com/@Haje/your-press-release-needs-images-22a70ac3e1b1#.dlo0ykfq4),
> the best [images] are something people can relate to in one way or another, which usually means that *the images need to tell part of the story*.

That's a good start, but doesn't offer much practical information. Luckily, we can always rely on science.

## Appeal

*Appeal* is our natural attraction towards an image. We might not be able to explain *why* we love an image because [our conscious thought hasn’t yet caught up with our subconscious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_relationship).

Immediate, emotional reactions are some of the strongest connections we can make to visual content. They occur from the part of the brain that is also related to our [survival instincts](http://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/wired-for-survival1.htm), which means that the reaction will likely be more direct and intense if it appeals to our emotions.

## Comprehension

*Comprehension* is linked to the way our brains translate data in order to simplify it. [It has been observed that 90% of the information sent to our brains is visual](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33423/19-Reasons-You-Should-Include-Visual-Content-in-Your-Marketing-Data.aspx#sm.00001ztsyhxnje9dr7r1i72p6g37j), with our brains responding to it 60,000 faster than they do for text.

Thus, our brains need a picture to process information faster and create a connection between the visual representation and its concept. It’s impressive how the visual perception in our brain makes such a complex task easy. This could also be a scientific explanation for why "an image is worth a thousand words.”

## Retention

*Retention* is related to the memorable experience that visual content tends to create. There are now [algorithms created by MIT researchers](http://news.mit.edu/2015/csail-deep-learning-algorithm-predicts-photo-memorability-near-human-levels-1215) that predict photos' memorability at near-human levels. According to the algorithm, [weird and counterintuitive images do well, as do conflict and suspense](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/12/29/forget-beautiful-sunrises-embrace-absurdity-heres-how-to-take-memorable-photos/).

*According to above theory, both of these strange stock images should get good scores on memorability. Yet the algorithm only found the guy using a cake as a pillow highly memorable.

## We scienced the $#!† out of images, so now what?

Keeping all of this science and psychology in mind while looking for an image feels overwhelming. To make it easier on ourselves, we set some relevant guidelines:

* **Images should trigger curiosity.** Don’t go for the obvious.
* **Images should create a context.** Establish an atmosphere into which you would like your readers to enter.
* **Images need to tell part of the story.** They should be relatable.
* **A header image should work on its own, even outside its context.** The header image is often the first and only thing people see. You want to grab their attention with *appeal* and *retention* quality.   

Especially if you’re collaborating on content, it’s important to be able to rationalise your images. With all the brain power we can muster (and that of people much smarter than us), we are trying to create contexts for our writing that people actually want to enter. Saying: “the image is beautiful and nice” just won’t cut it. Maybe just ask yourself: Are pictures of cappuccinos and laptops on desks worth a thousand words?
