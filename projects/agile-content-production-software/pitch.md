## Goal

To evangelize Agile content production

## [Definition of done](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/blob/ready/glossary/definition-of-done.md)

We described:

Advantages of Agile:
- Project management
- Editorial Kanban (goal oriented working)
- Branching content creation
- Review process

This leads to a team that is more:
- adaptible
- effective

Switching to Agile with a team is not daunting
- The initial costs
- The potential dangers of working Agile

Our software plan (in short at the end)

## Proposed method

This post will convince readers that when you create content with a team, you should do it Agile.
We'll describe the advantages Agile teams profit from and how this impacts their output.
By also highlighting the potential investment companies will need to make we'll change their minds from:

"Sounds good but too difficult for us at this moment / don't have time for this"
to:
"Oh, it will only lead to a small dip in productivity for a few weeks before I can reap these rewards"


## Motivation

This will show our mastery of Agile content production and will increase the market size for our software product.
It will be a post we can link to potential clients as well as investors.
It might get quite some traction!
