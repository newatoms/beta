## Goal
To reach people who are already familiar with agile working who will share our content, hire us to write content for them, or that we could hire.

## Method
We will write about the possibility of creating images via a collaborative, agile process (see https://github.com/blog/1902-svg-viewing-diffing) and the implications this could have on image-making. It would be interesting to question what this means in terms of personal expression and visual creativity, which is often perceived as an individual process.

## Motivation
Further elucidating our process within a surprising context that is normally not thought of as agile highlights one of the qualities that 'makes us special'.
