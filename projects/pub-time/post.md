Learning to communicate openly, honestly and respectfully about loaded issues removes barriers. Spending time offsite is a great catalyst for this.

Since we work in teams it’s crucial to understand and get to know each other. The value of intense meetings in a non-work related environment facilitates a different mindset. Making room for personal conversations increases the quality of the work. Productivity increases when everyone is on the same page while discussing the future of your company.

That’s why New Atoms, earlier this year, traveled to London for its first FNAC (Future New Atoms Conference).

The FNAC facilitated important talks about the the future of news, technology and the future in general. In the evening we switched topics by talking about riding bikes into canals, brawls at McDonalds, past romantic relationships, utopia and [hipsters](https://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/made-of-sock?utm_term=.prXqRlmP7G#.vgvERwOQ50). Most of the latter subjects unfolded in restaurants over large portions of meat, or in pubs with alcoholic beverages in hand.

Many times these lighter conversations gave rise to weightier topics. Topics like gender politics, the morale issues of advertising and our urge to break trough conventions. It was by discussing these things that all our individual assumptions began to emerge. When noticed that when the discussion would be the hottest, most of us were saying the same, unable to actually listen to the others.  The fear of being misunderstood stopped us from learning from each others perspectives.

It took us quite a few attempts to realise we were all on the same page. That if one of us has a strong opinion, we should not try to fight it with our own, but that we need to understand why these arguments are so important to them.

It was only by talking through these assumptions and learning how to *listen* that they began to melt away and be replaced by empathy. We were able to understand each other and see from one another's perspectives. We learned how to communicate effectively on a personal level, looking past our own baggage and assumptions.

It was only by talking through these assumptions and learning how to listen that they began to melt away and be replaced by empathy. We were able to understand each other and see from one another’s perspectives. We learned how to communicate effectively on a personal level. Aside from the beer drinking, having the opportunity to do this was arguably the most valuable thing we took away from our FNAC.

This understanding accompanied us back to Amsterdam and permeated our work-related conversations. Not only did it increased personal investment in our colleagues, it also enabled us to look at the world with a less clouded vision. It made us realise even more, that first you must understand what others are saying before you can respond.
