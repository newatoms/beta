**Sharing awkward stories and strong opinions outside the office builds more productive and efficient teams. When everyone learns to subdue their assumptions and starts to listen, collaboration will flourish.**

At New Atoms, our world spins by the virtue of great teamwork. We work together on all jobs at hand, contributing from our own experience. We never go it alone. Therefore, trust and mutual understanding are absolutely critical. Shared coffee breaks and regular after work beers are a start, but we believe they don't suffice.

Building trust and understanding requires a change of scenery, blended with good food and drinks, sprinkled with spirited work- and non-work-related discussions and silly jokes. As we like to call it: an off-site. Earlier this year, we traveled to London for our very first edition. Here's the story.

### Bonding over food, drinks and big topics  
Our days in London provided the perfect opportunity to talk about the business of journalism. Boris, our boss, gave daily talks about the the future of news, technology and the future in general.

In the evening, the conversations would transgress into talks about riding bikes into canals, our love for [Adventure Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBYZPdu22Cg) and past romantic relationships. But weightier topics, such as gender politics, the moral issues of advertising and our urge to break through conventions were also discussed. Most of these subjects unfolded in restaurants over large portions of food or in pubs with delicious beverages in hand. Having a brand new team member on board, these evenings facilitated becoming acquainted pressure-cooker style.

### Shutting up to reach mutual understanding
Not only did the off-site help us get to know each other better, a crucial thing it taught us was to stop talking and start listening.

Weighty conversations sometimes gave rise to heated discussions. As the temperature rose, our individual assumptions began to emerge. Most of us were saying the same things with different words, unable to actually listen to the others. The fear of being misunderstood stopped us from listening and made it impossible to learn from one another.

It took us quite a few attempts to realise we were all on the same page. If someone has a strong opinion, we should not try to fight it with our own, but rather understand what they are trying to convey.

It was only by talking through these assumptions and learning how to *listen* that they began to melt away and be replaced by empathy. We were able to understand each other and see from one another's perspectives. We learned how to communicate effectively on a personal level, looking past our own baggage and assumptions. We learned to trust.

### The tangible effects of our off-site
This understanding accompanied us back to Amsterdam and permeated our work-related conversations. Months later, we feel the positive effects of having met outside the usual environment. It gave us a different mindset and increased personal investment in our colleagues. We bonded through sharing personal stories and making new shared memories.

It enabled us to see our colleagues for the people they are instead of who we had made them out to be. Well-founded knowledge of one other made for more empathy and understanding, making our permanent collaboration a much more comfortable endeavour. Pardon us for getting a little sappy here, but we are certain these developments lead to more productive teamwork.

It also declouded our view of the world through a more analytical vision. It made us realise even more that you must first understand what others are saying before you can respond fairly and intelligently. Set aside your ego, take a step back, and go from there.

Our second off-site is planned in November, and we can't wait to find out what we will learn next.
