Sharing awkward stories builds stronger and more efficient teams.

When you work in teams where everybody is expected to contribute from their own experience and perspectives, it’s crucial to understand and get to know each other. Meetings in a non-work related environment gives you a different mindset. It enables you to see your colleagues for the people they are instead of why you made them out to be.

That’s why New Atoms, earlier this year, traveled to London for its first FNAC (Future New Atoms Conference).

The FNAC facilitated important talks about the the future of news, technology and the future in general. In the evening the conversations would transgress into talks about riding bikes into canals, our love for [Adventure Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBYZPdu22Cg) and past romantic relationships. Most of the latter subjects unfolded in restaurants over large portions of food, or in pubs with delicious beverages in hand.

Many times these lighter conversations gave rise to weightier topics. Topics like gender politics, the morale issues of advertising and our urge to break trough conventions. It was by discussing these things that all our individual assumptions began to emerge. When noticed that when the discussion would be the hottest, most of us were saying the same, unable to actually listen to the others.  The fear of being misunderstood stopped us from learning from each other.

It took us quite a few attempts to realise we were all on the same page. That if one of us has a strong opinion, we should not try to fight it with our own, but that we need to understand what they are trying to convey.

It was only by talking through these assumptions and learning how to *listen* that they began to melt away and be replaced by empathy. We were able to understand each other and see from one another's perspectives. We learned how to communicate effectively on a personal level, looking past our own baggage and assumptions.

This understanding accompanied us back to Amsterdam and permeated our work-related conversations. Not only did it increased personal investment in our colleagues, it also enabled us to look at the world with a less clouded vision. It made us realise even more, that first you must understand what others are saying before you can respond.
