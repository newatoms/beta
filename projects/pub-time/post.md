Learning to communicate openly, honestly and respectfully about loaded issues removes barriers.

Beer is a great catalyst for this.

Earlier this year, New Atoms traveled to London for its first FNAC (Future New Atoms Conference). Among a lot of important talks about the future of the company, the future of news, and the future in general, there were also talks about riding bikes into canals, altercations at McDonalds, past romantic relationships, and [hipsters](https://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/made-of-sock?utm_term=.prXqRlmP7G#.vgvERwOQ50). Most of the latter conversations transpired in restaurants over large portions of meat, or in pubs with libations in hand.

Many times (and there were many pub times), these lighter conversations gave rise to weightier topics, like gender politics. It was by discussing such things that all of our individual assumptions began to emerge.

It was only by talking through these assumptions and learning how to *listen* that they began to melt away and be replaced by empathy. We were able to understand each other and see from one another's perspectives. We learned how to communicate effectively on a personal level. Having the opportunity to do this was arguably the most valuable thing we took away from our FNAC.

This understanding accompanied us back to Amsterdam and permeated our work-related conversations. Because we left with an increased personal investment in our colleagues, our team is stronger and more effective every day.
