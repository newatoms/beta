Sharing awkward stories can build stronger and more efficient teams. Learning to communicate openly, honestly and respectfully about loaded issues removes barriers and enables team members to pierce trough their own assumptions.

Spending time offsite is a great catalyst for this since it enables you to detach the conversations from the day to day topics.

Earlier this year, New Atoms traveled to London for its first FNAC (Future New Atoms Conference). Among a lot of important talks about the future of the company, the future of news, and the future in general. There were also talks about riding bikes into canals, brawls at McDonalds, past romantic relationships, utopias and [hipsters](https://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/made-of-sock?utm_term=.prXqRlmP7G#.vgvERwOQ50). Most of the latter subjects unfolded in restaurants over large portions of food, or in pubs with delicious beverages in hand.

Many times (because we were in many pubs), these lighter conversations gave rise to weightier topics, like gender politics, the morale issues of advertising and our urge to break trough conventions. It was by discussing these things that all of our individual assumptions began to emerge. Often we noticed that when the discussions would be hottest, arguments would be the the same, formulated in such a way that that both sides assumed they disagreed.

It took us quite a few attempts to realize we were all on the same side, that when one of us has a strong opinion on something we should not try to fight it with our own, but that we need to understand why these arguments are so important to our team members. We discovered, more that once, that our fierceness did not come from the specific topic but from some underlying current, often caused by personal history.

It was only by talking through these assumptions and learning how to *listen* that they began to melt away and be replaced by empathy. We were able to understand each other and see from one another's perspectives. We learned how to communicate effectively on a personal level. Aside from the drinking, having the opportunity to do this was arguably the most valuable thing we took away from our FNAC.

This understanding accompanied us back to Amsterdam and permeated our work-related conversations. Because we left with an increased personal investment in our colleagues, our team is stronger and more effective every day.
