**Sharing awkward stories and heavy opinions outside of the office builds stronger and more efficient teams. Especially when everyone learns to subdue their assumptions and starts to listen.**

At New Atoms, our world spins by the virtue of great teamwork. We work together on all jobs at hand, contributing from our own experience. We never go it alone. Therefore, trust and mutual understanding are absolutely crucial. Shared coffee breaks and regular after work beers are a start, but we believe they don't suffice.

Building trust and understanding requires a change of scenery, mixed up with good food and drinks, sprinkled with heavy work- and non-work-related discussions and silly jokes. As we like to call it: an off-site. Earlier this year, we traveled to London for our very first edition. Here's the story.


The off-site facilitated important talks about the the future of news, technology and the future in general. In the evening, the conversations would transgress into talks about riding bikes into canals, our love for [Adventure Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBYZPdu22Cg) and past romantic relationships. Most of the latter subjects unfolded in restaurants over large portions of food or in pubs with delicious beverages in hand.

Many times, these lighter conversations gave rise to weightier topics—topics like gender politics, the moral issues of advertising and our urge to break through conventions. It was by discussing these things that all our individual assumptions began to emerge. We noticed that when the discussion became heated, most of us were saying the same things with different words, unable to actually listen to the others. The fear of being misunderstood stopped us from listening and made it impossible to learn from each other.

It took us quite a few attempts to realise we were all on the same page—that if someone has a strong opinion, we should not try to fight it with our own, but rather to understand what they are trying to convey.

It was only by talking through these assumptions and learning how to *listen* that they began to melt away and be replaced by empathy. We were able to understand each other and see from one another's perspectives. We learned how to communicate effectively on a personal level, looking past our own baggage and assumptions. We learned to trust.

This understanding accompanied us back to Amsterdam and permeated our work-related conversations. Months later, we feel the positive effects. Not only did it increase personal investment in our colleagues, it also enabled us to look at the world with a less clouded, more analytical vision. It made us realise even more that you must first understand what others are saying before you can respond fairly and intelligently.
