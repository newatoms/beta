### Goal

To illustrate the importance of having an off-site for team-building.

### Method
We will write about the New Atoms off-site future conference, specifically the team's time spent in various pubs and its effect on the team months later.  

### Example
We could write about some of the important issues we discussed, for example feminism. Learning to communicate openly, honestly and respectfully about loaded issues removes barriers. This is a precursor to similar communication in a work environment, helping everyone to feel safe and respected.

### Motivation
Spending time together as a team outside of work is extremely helpful in developing meaningful relationships. An emotional investment in one's colleagues makes for a more devoted team and a stronger, more empathetic and effective organisation overall.

### Assumptions
That the team would not be opposed to revealing some more personal (but not too personal) events, conversations and views.

### Assistance
Short interviews with the team; around 10 minutes.
