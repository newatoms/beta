## Goal
To grow both new and existing audiences by showing that New Atoms' methods are simultaneously creative and grounded in science.

## Proposed Method
We will write a post about some of the things that make for an effective image according to psychological and scientific research, and the ways in which the editorial team strives to find article-accompanying images based on these ideas.

### Example
We could use the information about appeal, comprehension and retention (memorability) in the *Sciencing the $@% out of images* guide as a starting point for this article. We could also exhibit one of the team's real "image trajectories" and the rationalization thereof (the progression of images found for an article and the reasons for choosing them, leading to the final image used).

## Motivation
Highlighting and exposing this piece of New Atoms' process illuminates it in a different light and shows the legitimacy of their decisions, helping to form a positive perception of the company for all readers.
