# We are a Protagonist in the Story of IT

## Goal
To *show the organisations impact on the future*, we will write about *our Vision* to show how *modern* thinking enables New Atoms to excel in *Media Production* written from the perspective of a(n) *Internal Editorial Team*.

## Method
We will write an article about the trajectory of information technology related to media, and the ways in which New Atoms is both merging into the IT narrative and contributing to its direction and propulsion.

## Example
The article could be in more of a narrative style, telling the story of IT/media and introducing New Atoms as a protagonist in the story (inspired by the telegram "puppet theater" at the London Museum of Natural History). Within this narrative, we could also write about the ways in which media production has become irrelevant to our time, and how New Atoms is addressing the industry's current needs.

## Motivation
By showing New Atoms' awareness of the IT trajectory over time, it will be apparent that New Atoms is also aware of where the trajectory will go in the future. Showing that New Atoms knows where they fall within this timeline and will help to determine its direction makes evident that the company will have an impact on the future.
