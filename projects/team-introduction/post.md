How could we ever strive to understand the world if no more than half of our team members have a significant degree, and even less of us has relevant work experience?

We don't hire on experience, we hire on personality.

Our team(s) work in hyper-collaboration. Every product we make is the result of a team building iteratively on one another's work, giving feedback every time we add something new. This way individual skills matter less than the ability to function in a team.

# To which aspects of personality do we pay attention?

## Leave the ego at the door

In order to be able to function as a team, our teams need to take ownership over everything they produce. Even though we all have the romantic idea of having one superstar that brings the entire team to a higher level, we often do not realize that with great skill often comes great ego.

Having an inflated ego is not only annoying for the people around us, it is actually dangerous for our process since it will almost always result in heated disagreements.

The fear of hurting the ego of a team member will often lead to a lower production rate and lower overall quality. How can we ever improve something if nobody dares to point out what needs improving?

## Hunger to learn

The mission of New Atoms is to 'understand the world and make valuable products from that understanding'. Every person working at New Atoms should therefore have a thirst for learning. For us, learning is not about knowing everything there is to know about one topic, but about gathering knowledge about many things and making connections between them. We believe this hunger can be a learned skill, but we try to find people who have an intrinsic motivation to learn.

## Open for discussions

We don't do managers. We don't do oversight. This means that teams choose their own paths and update their own workflows. To do this effectively, teams need to communicate fluidly and give room for each team member to share their opinion. This only works when members value discussions highly, enjoy obtaining insights together, and acknowledge that there is a time and place for discussions.
