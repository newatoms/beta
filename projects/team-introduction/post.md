How could we ever presume to add value to the world if no more than half of our team members have a significant degree, and even less of us have relevant work experience?

We don't hire on experience, we hire on personality and mindset.

Our team(s) work in hyper-collaboration. Every product we make is the result of a team building iteratively on one another's work, giving feedback every time we add something new. This way, individual skills matter less than the ability to function effectively as part of a team.

# It's a complicated thing, this ego

In order to function well, our teams need to take ownership over everything they produce. The biggest hurdle in this is ego.

It is never easy to receive feedback for something into which you put a lot of effort, though outside input might improve it greatly. The more you feel responsible for the whole, the harder it becomes.

When a [post.supply](https://post.supply/) team starts working for a new client, the first step is always to understand what they do and why they do it. This requires a lot of research and reflection. At one point, Matthijs, the team's business developer, had made an inaccurate assumption leading to two articles being close to useless. "Even though I knew I was wrong, I just could not admit it." It's a hard thing, this ego. "It took me quite a while to realise that Sam and Thomas where trying to help the team, not discredit *me*," Matthijs says.

"When something like that happens, I always try to ask questions that help someone make a distinction between overall quality and their own ego," Sam, the team's technical developer, tells us.

The fear of hurting the ego of another team member will often lead to a lower production rate and lower overall quality. How can we ever improve something if nobody dares to point out what needs improving?

In order to prevent things like this from happening,  teams are encouraged to discuss everything in the way of doing their work with their team members rather than with a manager, someone from HR or in an employee evaluation.

Even though this might be a bit uncomfortable in the beginning, it leads to more open, stronger, and more productive teams.
