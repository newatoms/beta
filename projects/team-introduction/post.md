We don't hire on experience, we hire on personality.

Our team(s) work in a particular way we call agile journalism. All products we make are the result of a team building iteratively on one another's work, giving feedback with each iteration. This means that individual skills matter less than the ability to function in a team.

# So to which aspects of personality do we pay attention?

## Leave the ego at the door

We create products together, and so take ownership over everything we produce together.
Having an inflated ego is actually dangerous for our process since it will almost always result in heated disagreements with the team member reviewing your work, a slower production rate and most likely an increase in stress levels.
Egos also hamper learning within a team, since people will fear the potential backlash of giving feedback.

## Hunger to learn

The mission of New Atoms is to 'understand the world'. All people working at New Atoms should therefore have a thirst for learning. For us, learning is not about knowing everything there is to know about one topic, but about gathering knowledge about multiple topics and linking the knowledge together. We believe this hunger can be learned skill, but we try to find people who have a natural motivation to learn.

## Open for discussions

We don't do managers. We don't do oversight. This means that teams choose their own paths and update their own workflows. To do this effectively teams need to communicate effectively and give room for each team member to share their opinion. This only works when members value discussions highly, enjoy obtaining insights together and acknowledge that there is a time and place for discussions.
