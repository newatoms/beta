On her own website:
Raised in Colorado, Krysten Koehn spent her adolescence immersed in the landscape of the Rocky Mountains. It is this landscape and her experiences therein, coupled with consistent itinerancy, that have critically formed her person and practice and surface frequently in the content of her work.

Krysten is currently a practicing artist in New York, where she has lived since completing her MFA in Painting and Printmaking at the Yale School of Art in 2013. Previously, she realized a BA in Photography and Fiber Design (2001) and an MA in Art Education (2007). The subsequent four years brought her overseas, first to Kuwait then to Switzerland, where she worked as an artist and art educator. Her current work is heavily process-based, examining themes of the body within the landscape, transience, trajectory, and the assimilation of her body into her immediate context through physical activity.

Ultimately, Krysten aspires to create work that expands awareness by offering a view of her specific experience of the world. Her work places this experience into the context of a greater whole in which individual viewers can find their own experiences and from which they can draw stimulus for embarking on their own while remaining accountable to the ensemble of humanity.
