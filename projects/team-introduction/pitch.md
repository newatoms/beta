# New Atoms: The Team

## GOAL
To attract new and returning readers who could hire us, work for us or share our content with those who could, by putting a face/faces with the company.

## METHOD
Based on personal stories from team members, we introduce your team and show how the way New Atoms works, is different from the ways in which your team members have worked before. We can also show what their background is and how their skills and experiences add variety and value to the team. Overall it should show the reader how New Atoms makes your team members happier employees and happier people in general. Preferable the article(s) would be accompanied by a photo of each team member or the team as a whole, depending on the form of the article.

### example
It could be one article in which each team member is described in a single paragraph. It could also be turned into a series, as a kind of tag-team race, where one employee is centered in one piece (maybe interviewed by another member of the team) and he/she hands over the stick to the next employee. This last option the option open to write a new article with the addition of a new team member.

## ASSISTANCE
- Interview the team members
OR
- have everyone write something about themselves, acccording to some kind of set format.

We would also need assistance with appropriate photos of team members, to make sure that the photos are all in a similiar style, or a photo of the whole team - depending on if it's one article or a series of articles.

## MOTIVATION
A kind of behind-the-scenes of the company is always a good way to add a personal touch and spark interest/personal sympathy with the reader. It also shows the different backgrounds of team members and how this diversity can add value. This can be interesting for (potential) clients as well as potential team members, or anybody else who is interested in what we're doing for that matter.
