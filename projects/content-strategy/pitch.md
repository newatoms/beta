## Goal
To understand why we are writing Beta articles, consequently what they should be like, and how they can contribute to accomplishing our goals

## [Definition of done](https://github.com/newatoms/guides/blob/ready/glossary/definition-of-done.md)
All team members can understand
* what a content strategy is
* what the Beta content strategy is
* the practical implications of the Beta content strategy  (e.g. what kind of articles should be written)

Also:
* taking the content strategy into account when writing Beta articles is included in our workflow

## Proposed method
* write a guide on what content strategy is
* figure out what the content strategy for Beta should be (including goals, target audience, competition)
* update Beta brief accordingly
* possibly update configuration with new knowledge
* add a checkbox that says 'in compliance with content strategy' in Achievable flow

## Motivation
Without a content strategy we are working towards nothing in particular, as we don't have goals to keep in mind. This is out of line with the New Atoms goal-oriented working method. Besides that learning about content strategies is very valuable, as our product is directly affiliated to this.
