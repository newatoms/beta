# How Sol LeWitt was the predecessor to working agile

## Goal
To reach people who may not otherwise resonate with a workflow inspired by software building/new technology

## Method
We will write about how the process of installing Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings (collaboration, forgoing ego) is similar to the New Atoms workflow.

## Motivation
By putting a very different sector into the context of our specific workflow shows that it is in fact accessible and interesting to those outside the technology sector.
