# Pub Time is Business Time

## Goal
To *show how good the organisation is*, we will write about *the entrepeneur and the team* to show how a *collaborative* atmosphere enables individuals to excel in *research and understanding*, written from the perspective of a(n) *Internal Editorial Team*.

## Method
We will write about the New Atoms off-site future conference, specifically the team's time spent in various pubs.  

## Example
We could write about some of the various important issues we discussed, for example feminism. We would explain how learning to communicate openly, honestly and respectfully about loaded issues removes barriers to speaking the same way in a work environment and helps everyone feel safe to do so.

## Motivation
Spending time together as a team outside of work is extremely helpful in developing meaningful relationships. An emotional investment in one's colleagues makes for a more devoted team and a stronger, more empathetic and effective organisation overall.

## Assumptions
That the team would not be opposed to revealing some more personal (but not too personal) events, conversations and views.

## Assistance
Short interviews with the team; around 10 minutes.
