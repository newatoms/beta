Everyone who starts a company is very concerned with hiring the right talent. Venture funding backed startups pay insane salaries for talent with impressive CVs and proven track records. Yet Google’s internal research into this has shown the best performing teams were not those made out of the brightest individuals.

So what makes the best teams?

## Differing perspectives are the key

In our finer moments, we humans try to imagine how others see the world. Yet, these views are warped by our own position, ideas and experiences. We can imagine being a tourist in our city for the first time, unaware of stepping into the bike lane because we are so overwhelmed with new stimuli. Putting ourselves in the shoes of others is a conduit for empathy.

Each individual's worldview is made up of countless experiences and perspectives. People easily switch between these views, as can be seen while navigating traffic in the city:

It is human to feel like *we* are at the center of the universe and that everyone should comply to *our* rules. When we're on a bike, everyone participating in the city's movement is interrupting our trajectory. But when we're in a car, we feel like both cyclists and pedestrians are hazardous. They are unpredictable projectiles that don't follow the rules—rules that would make traffic safe, if only everyone would comply to them.

> The most effective method for upgrading knowledge is by cooperating with others

When being open to different perspectives, we also tend to be pretty good at upgrading our knowledge. This occurs when we are confronted with inconsistencies, obtain new insights or learn new facts. The best way to encounter such opportunities is by cooperating with others, because it's the most direct and practical way to experience a different view.

Collaborative situations require you to focus your discussions, use constructive arguments and explain your thought processes. At times we are confronted with unfamiliar topics. These moments are very valuable because they show a gap in our knowledge and let us fill that gap by "stealing" the knowledge of others, as long as we feel safe to do so.          

## Feeling safe, accelerator of learning

Google studied what made great teams great. [The research from Project Aristotle](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=1) shows the best performing teams were not those made out of the brightest individuals. The best performing teams were those with the most *psychological safety*. Their research, in which they analysed how their teams were functioning, showed that a safe environment enables team members to take risks and explain their doubts.

Abeer Dubey, a leader on the project and manager in Google’s People Analytics division, said: "We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter."

Incredibly, the productivity of people working together has little to do with how smart or cool or experienced they all are. It has everything to do with feeling safe. And feeling safe has everything to do with knowing we are all understood—that judgements will not be speeding towards us like unpredictable projectiles—which inherently means understanding the perspectives of others. And the most genuine path to understanding, is through collaboration.


## So how do we make the best teams?

We’re betting on a combination of diversity and trust over resumes and star-status. Our founder Boris sees the A-Team as a rolemodel. “They could be locked up in a barn and figure out how to build a tank out of what was in there, I believe that a group of very different smart people can work their way out of any situation.”

Our teams are made up out of people that are as different as possible, while still focussed on certain outcomes. This means there is no editorial, marketing or back-end development team. “All of our teams should have access to every important aspect of developing the company, and everyone should be able to contribute whatever they can.”

We hope that, with this knowledge, we can foster teams that can handle any challenge.
