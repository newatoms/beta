Each individual's worldview is made up of countless experiences and perspectives. People easily switch between these views, as can be seen while navigating traffic in the city:

No matter what vehicle we use, we feel like *we* are at the center of traffic and that everyone should comply to *our* rules. When we're on a bike, everyone participating in the city's movement is interrupting our trajectory. But when we're in a car, we feel like both cyclists and pedestrians are hazardous. They are unpredictable projectiles that don't follow the rules—rules that would make traffic safe, if only everyone would comply to them.

We ourselves easily flip-flop perspectives depending on our current situation. These views, however, are warped by our own position, ideas and experiences. In our finer moments, we also try to imagine how others see the world. We can imagine being a tourist in our city for the first time, unaware of stepping into the bike lane because we are so overwhelmed with new stimuli. Putting ourselves in the shoes of others is a conduit for empathy.

> The most effective method for upgrading knowledge is by cooperating with others

When being open to different perspectives, we also tend to be pretty good at upgrading our knowledge. This occurs when we are confronted with inconsistencies, obtain new insights or learn new facts. The best way to encounter such opportunities is by cooperating with others, because it's the most direct and practical way to experience a different view.

Collaborative situations require us to focus our discussions, use constructive arguments and explain our thought processes. At times we are confronted with unfamiliar topics. These moments are very valuable because they show a gap in our knowledge and let us fill that gap by "stealing" the knowledge of others, as long as we feel safe to do so.          

## It's all about **psychological safety**

New Atoms is doing everything they can to create this *safe zone*. It means that everyone is equal and this enables everyone in the team to show when they're in doubt. With collaboration, this vulnerability is key to get to the core of a problem. If team mates feel too proud to show their weaknesses it gets in the way of problems that are easily solvable. Besides, how can team mates fill each other's "knowledge gaps" if there's no room for mistakes?

Google has performed studies showing that the best performing teams were all about *psychological safety*. Their research, in which they analyzed how their teams were functioning, showed that a safe environment enables team members to take risks and explain their doubts. Charles Duhigg of the New York Times wrote a piece about it: [What Google Learned From its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=1).

In this article, Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, said: "We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter."

Incredibly, the productivity of people working together has nothing to do with how smart or cool or experienced they all are. It has everything to do with feeling safe. And feeling safe has everything to do with knowing we are all understood—that judgements will not be speeding towards us like unpredictable projectiles—which inherently means understanding the perspectives of others. And the most genuine path to understanding, is through collaboration.
