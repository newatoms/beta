# What Krysten learned about working iteratively from installing Sol LeWitt

## Goal
To *Create new audience* we will write about *The Entrepeneur and the team* to show how *Collaborative* enables you to excel in *Research and Understanding* written from the perspective of a(n) *Internal Editorial Team*.

## Method
We will write about how being involved in the process of installing Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings (due to the necessities of collaboration and forgoing ego) makes merging into the New Atoms culture and workflow quite natural.

## Example
We could interview Krysten about her experience installing Wall Drawings and write about how this experience prepared her to work iteratively.

## Motivation
By putting a very different sector into the context of New Atoms' specific workflow shows that it is in fact accessible and interesting to those outside the technology sector. This type of article will reach people who may not otherwise resonate with a workflow inspired by software building/new technology.

## Assistance
A 30-40 minute interview with Krysten
