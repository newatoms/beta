## Goal
To show how a very different field's work process is similar New Atoms' workflow in order to connect with a potential audience outside the technology and journalism sectors

## Method
We will write about how being involved in the process of installing Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings (due to the necessities of collaboration and forgoing ego) helped Krysten merge into the New Atoms culture and workflow quite naturally.

## Example
We could interview Krysten about her experience installing Wall Drawings and write about how this experience prepared her to work within the New Atoms work process.

## Motivation
Putting a very different sector into the context of New Atoms-specific workflow shows that it is in fact accessible and interesting to those outside the technology and journalism sectors. This type of article will reach people who may not otherwise resonate with a workflow inspired by software building/new technology.

## Assistance
A 30-40 minute interview with Krysten
