question: What is a pitch?
---

A pitch is a proposal for a piece of content that we think would be good to make.

We frequently do research and brainstorm to find great ideas for content to make. We suggest these ideas to you as _pitches_, after which you choose which ones we'll make by _commissioning_ them.
