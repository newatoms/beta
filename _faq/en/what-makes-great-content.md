question: What is a good blog post?
---

How do you attract and engage readers? Standard advice: deliver 'high quality content'. Sure, we agree, but what does this mean exactly? Here we will explain the key concepts: authenticity, flow, imagery, make up, conciseness and language. 

Good content is original,  and targeted towards a certain audience. Think about the cases in which you would like to read the post. Gear towards optimizing the experience for those cases.

## Content

Write what matters to the reader. Reread often and in different situations. Your own situation changes the way you read previously written sentences. Let other people read the post. Don't be afraid to throw away the whole post and start again. The second time will go a lot quicker and the result is always an improvement.
Select one type of content per post. This will allow you to choose the correct imagery, flow, style etc.

## Style  
  
The type of content goes hand in hand with the writing style. Style can be concise and sharp when the reader is searching for a short answer. A good example: [how to use the github repository](www.blog.com).
Otherwise, if you want to entice a certain feeling you want to emerge the user in your world. Use sentences that sketch a situation, use words with an emotional impact, play with empathy and imagery. Leave certain concepts vague to let the readers create their own version. We use [this blog](www.blog.com) as an example. 
There are a lot of good styles to choose from [see overview](www.blog.com). 

## Make up

Depending on the use of the blog you can choose from several types of make up. If the reader is searching for an answer you want a big header signalling 'Solution'. In a large editorial piece you can foreshadow certain content by breaking text and inserting a quote.  
  ["Entering a quote can be a good way to keep the reader's attention" ]
  
  A well structured text gives guidance and leads the reader towards its conclusion in a gentle, organic fashion. A clear text consists of:

* The title
* An intro
* Headers 
* **Bold** en *italic*  
* Short paragraphs 
* Clear quotes 
**Bold** en *italic* words make sure that highlighted concepts are cleared up. *Short paragraphs* are there to make the text understandable for the reader. *Clear quotes*, then, invite the reader to keep on reading. 

## Imagery

No image? Forget about it...
Humans are visual creatures. Research done by [Skyword](http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/enterprise-marketing/skyword-study-add-images-to-improve-content-performance/) has shown that chances a text will be read are increased with **94%** if the article shown has an image. 
Photo's and illustrations together with the right title make the reader curious and excited. 

Most important is that the images enrich the article in the sense that they serve the written piece. Images should create a certain amount of context. A good mantra, with the addition of more multimedia in the back of our minds, is not "form follows content" but "content follows form".

##  Flow

A strong and remarkable *title* is important to attract your reader. A good title should activate, interest and excite. Often enough with newspaper articles—also the digital ones—the title is the key component in attracting the reader.

If you have lured your reader with a fantastic title, he often decides whether to keep on reading or not based on the first few sentences. This brings us to the intro of the text and the importance hereof. 

> If the title and image are the bait, the intro is the line that has to be strong enough to pull the reader in. 

The *intro* is the first paragraph and supports a well chosen title. With this beginning the reader is either triggered and will stay, or not. Readers will scan the intro and decide in just a matter of seconds whether they want to keep on reading.





## Extra

Apart from originality high quality content also makes a certain promise about the credibility of the text. When sources are been used they should provide authority. Good sources are crucial and make sure that a text is taken seriously. 

According to Jacob Nielsen of the [Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/), a visitor spends an average of less than a minute on a web-page. The visitor usually only has time to read a quarter of the text presented. If the content has a clear message or benefit the chances it will be read are heightened. Quality content aims to give the reader new insights about a specific topic. 

 

* Depth of explanation
* Use of jargon
* Language style
* Ways to keep the audience engaged (e.g. ask questions, foreshadow what is coming, etc.)
