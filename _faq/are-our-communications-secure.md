question: Are our communications secure?
---
Yes, we use a certificate to communicate between you and the database service we use that has an incredibly strong 2048-bits key. All communications are sent over this connection.

The database service we use is Firebase, a company owned by Google and in the USA. They have [extensive terms](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-terms) available.

If you need communication with us that cannot pass through Firebase/Google, please let us know and we'll provision a special service for you.
