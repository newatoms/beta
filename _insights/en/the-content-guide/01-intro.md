## Intro

Why do you need content marketing? Content marketing is a way to create a bond between a reader and a company. 
Example: A solar cell company posts blogposts about: 
- how a solar cell works 
- a comparison between green energy products 
- a foto collage of employees risking their lives on roofs
Readers will eagerly read the content and couple this inspired feeling to the company logo. When they think about solar cells they will think about that company!
