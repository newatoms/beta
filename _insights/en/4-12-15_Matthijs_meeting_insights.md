Short term clients -> we want this product at the end of the week

Near future:
Growth most important. Doesn't matter whether more money or more potential for further investments.
Start: 3 months with 1 client. Play around with interface/pitching/subscription form

Client for first 3 months:
Editorial or risky for Google apl?
Small -> less risk, but also less prestige
Must have nothing to lose
Search for companies that struggle with social media
Make a list of potential companies -> look at their social media -> call them
(lego; politie; rijks; nu.nl; (sustainable)clothing companies; Boris has better list)
Look for (sustainability)competitions. For example by banks. Content by content.supply can be the prize

Initial communication:

Very cheap at startupfase
Would you be interested in face to face talk?

Give person who gives feedback spotify, netflix etc. to make it worth their while
