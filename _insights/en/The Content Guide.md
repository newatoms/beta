# The Content Guide

How do you attract your readers and how do you keep them close? More and more there is a cry for *'high quality content'*. And that is good, but what does this mean exactly? After learning these few key concepts, chances are your blog post is read and shared as well.

## Originality & authenticity

Good content is original. [Content Farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm) are no longer wanted in these times. Search enginges, such as Google, are getting better and better at detecting these 'clickbait sites' and these sites are not recieved well. Original content is sure to be shared more often. Even more so, why would you say something when it's not worth saying?

> You share content because you want to achieve a certain goal. You want it to be read, and you want the reader to learn something from it.

Apart from originality high quality content also makes a certain promise about the credibility of the text. When sources are been used they should provide authority. Good sources are crucial and make sure that a text is taken seriously. 

## Attract the reader and don't let go

Readers are looking for answers and want to find them in the easiest, fastest way. A well structured text gives guidance and leads the reader towards its conclusion in a gentle, organic fashion. A clear text consists of:

* The title
* An intro
* Headers 
* **Bold** en *italic*  
* Short paragraphs 
* Clear quotes 

A strong and remarkable *title* is important to attract your reader. A good title should activate, interest and excite. Often enough with newspaper articles—also the digital ones—the title is the key component in attracting the reader.

If you have lured your reader with a fantastic title, he often decides whether to keep on reading or not based on the first few sentences. This brings us to the intro of the text and the importance hereof. 

> If the title and image are the bait, the intro is the line that has to be strong enough to pull the reader in. 

The *intro* is the first paragraph and supports a well chosen title. With this beginning the reader is either triggerd and will stay, or not. Readers will scan the intro and decide in just a matter of seconds whether they want to keep on reading.

**Bold** en *italic* words make sure that highlighted concepts are cleared up. *Short paragraphs* are there to make the text understandable for the reader. *Clear quotes*, then, invite the reader to keep on reading. 

According to Jacob Nielsen of the [Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/), a visitor spends an avarage of less than a minute on a webpage. The visitor usually only has time to read a quarter of the text presented. If the content has a clear message or benefit the chances it will be read are hightenend. Quality content aims to give the reader new insights about a specific topic. 

## No image? Forget about it...
Humans are visual creatures. Research done by [Skyword](http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/enterprise-marketing/skyword-study-add-images-to-improve-content-performance/) has shown that chances a text will be read are increased with **94%** if the article shown has an image. 
Photo's and illustrations together with the right title make the reader curious and excited. 

> 94% the growth an article goes through if it has a relevant main image, compared to an article that has none. 

Most important is that the images enriche the article in the sense that they serve the written piece. Images should create a certain amount of context. A good mantra, with the addition of more multimedia in the back of our minds, is not "form follows content" but "content follows form".

Our content developers have aquired all these qualities in their own practice. Besides that, each one of are team member contributes to every post made, which makes sure that all these diverse qualities are brought together in one big whole, which makes for the best content possible.
