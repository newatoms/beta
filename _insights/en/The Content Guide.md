# The Content Guide

How do you attract your readers and how do you keep them close? More and more there is a cry for *'high quality content'*. That's all good, but what does this mean exactly? Which ingrediënts do you have to use to make a nice meal that people will remember? Better even, how do you make the perfect dish for guests that they will ask the recipe off and share it with others? Also explained: the art of finding 

## Originality & authenticity

Good content is original. [Content Farms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_farm) are no longer wanted in these times. Search enginges, such as Google, are getting better and better at detecting these 'clickbait sites' and these sites are not recieved well. Original content is sure to be shared more often. Even more so, why would you say something when it's not worth saying?

> You share content because you want to achieve a certain goal. You want it to be read, and you want the reader to learn something from it.

Apart from originality high quality content also makes a certain promise about the credibility of the text. When sources are been used they should provide authority. Good sources are crucial and make sure that a text is taken seriously. 

Be a guardian of the originality and authenticity of your content piece. It's easier sad than done while we all scrape information from different kind of sources. When it's authority in people you interview, articles, books or your own judgement, it's all based on other work. The difference where you as an author come in, is how you handle these sources. Combine them to share new insights. 

Repetition is not always a bad thing, it can be a powerful tool, but know that it will only work when it's used for original, compelling observations. High quality content is creative and has the potential to exite audiences.   

## Structure & readability

Readers are looking for answers and want to find them in the easiest, fastest way. A well structured text gives guidance and leads the reader towards its conclusion in a gentle, organic fashion. A clear text consists of:

* The title
* An intro
* Headers 
* **Bold** and *italic*  
* Short paragraphs 
* Clear quotes 

A strong and remarkable *title* is important to attract your reader. A good title should activate, interest and excite. Often enough with newspaper articles—also the digital ones— the title is the key component in attracting the reader.

If you have lured your reader with a fantastic title, he/she often decides whether to keep on reading or not based on the first few sentences. This brings us to the intro of the text and the importance hereof. 

> If the title and image are the bait, the intro is the line that has to be strong enough to pull the reader in. 

The *intro* is officiously the first paragraph, and also supports a well chosen title. With this beginning the reader is either triggerd and will stay, or not. Readers will scan the intro and decide in just a matter of seconds whether they want to keep on reading. The intro can consist of a promise that you make. Remember that readers are tend to find answers to their 'problems'. They were luwered in with the title as a hook and now they realy want to know of the content is worth there precious time. 

**Bold** en *italic* words make sure that highlighted concepts are cleared up. *Short paragraphs* are there to make the text understandable for the reader. *Clear quotes*, then, invite the reader to keep on reading. 

## Visitor spending time

With the ever growing content, the bad and the good, content developers should know how readers behave on the web and how they 

According to Jacob Nielsen of the [Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/), a visitor spends an avarage of less than a minute on a webpage. The visitor usually only has time to read a quarter of the text presented. If the content has a clear message or benefit the chances it will be read are hightenend. Quality content aims to give the reader new insights about a specific topic.

## No image? Forget about it...

Humans are visual creatures. Research done by [Skyword](http://www.skyword.com/contentstandard/enterprise-marketing/skyword-study-add-images-to-improve-content-performance/) has shown that chances a text will be read are increased with **94%** if the article shown has an image. 
Photo's and illustrations together with the right title make the reader curious and excited. 

> 94% the growth an article goes through if it has a relevant main image, compared to an article that has none. 

Most important is that the images enriche the article in the sense that they serve the written piece. Apart from estetics images should create a certain amount of context. A good mantra, with the addition of more multimedia in the back of our minds, is not "form follows content" but "content follows form".
